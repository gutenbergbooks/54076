<div class="dchappre">
<p class="pfirst">[<i>First
published in</i> The Westminster Review
<i>for April 1854</i>.]</p></div>

<p>Whoever has studied the physiognomy of political meetings,
cannot fail to have remarked a connexion between
democratic opinions and peculiarities of costume. At a
Chartist demonstration, a lecture on Socialism, or a <i>soirée</i>
of the Friends of Italy, there will be seen many among the
audience, and a still larger ratio among the speakers, who
get themselves up in a style more or less unusual. One
gentleman on the platform divides his hair down the centre,
instead of on one side; another brushes it back off the forehead,
in the fashion known as “bringing out the intellect;”
a third has so long forsworn the scissors, that his locks
sweep his shoulders. A sprinkling of moustaches may be
observed; here and there an imperial; and occasionally
some courageous breaker of conventions exhibits a full-grown
beard.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn1" id="fnanch1">1</a>
This nonconformity in hair is countenanced
by various nonconformities in dress, shown by others of the
assemblage. Bare necks, shirt-collars <i>à la</i> Byron, waistcoats
cut Quaker fashion, wonderfully shaggy great coats,
numerous oddities in form and colour, destroy the monotony
usual in crowds. Even those exhibiting no conspicuous
peculiarity, frequently indicate by something in the pattern
of their clothes, that they pay small regard
to what their <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
tailors tell them about the prevailing taste. And when the
gathering breaks up, the varieties of head gear displayed—the
number of caps, and the abundance of felt hats—suffice
to prove that were the world at large like-minded,
the black cylinders which tyrannize over us would soon
be deposed.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch1" id="fn1">1</a>
This was written before moustaches and beards had become general.</p></div>

<p>This relationship between political discontent and disregard
of customs exists on the Continent also. Red
republicanism is everywhere distinguished by its hirsuteness.
The authorities of Prussia, Austria, and Italy, alike
recognize certain forms of hat as indicative of disaffection,
and fulminate against them accordingly. In some places
the wearer of a blouse runs a risk of being classed among
the <i>suspects</i>; and in others, he who would avoid the bureau
of police, must beware how he goes out in any but the
ordinary colours. Thus, democracy abroad, as at home,
tends towards personal singularity. Nor is this association
of char­ac­ter­is­tics peculiar to modern times, or to reformers
of the State. It has always existed; and it has been
manifested as much in religious agitations as in political
ones. The Puritans, disapproving of the long curls of the
Cavaliers, as of their principles, cut their own hair short,
and so gained the name of “Roundheads.” The marked
religious nonconformity of the Quakers was accompanied
by an equally-marked nonconformity of manners—in attire,
in speech, in salutation. The early Moravians not only
believed differently, but at the same time dressed differently,
and lived differently, from their fellow Christians. That
the association between political independence and independence
of personal conduct, is not a phenomenon of
to-day only, we may see alike in the appearance of Franklin
at the French court in plain clothes, and in the white hats
worn by the last generation of radicals. Originality of
nature is sure to show itself in more ways than one. The
mention of George Fox’s suit of leather, or Pestalozzi’s
school name, “Harry Oddity,” will at
once suggest the <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
remembrance that men who have in great things diverged
from the beaten track, have frequently done so in small
things likewise. Minor illustrations may be gathered in
almost every circle. We believe that whoever will number
up his reforming and rationalist acquaintances, will find
among them more than the usual proportion of those who in
dress or behaviour exhibit some degree of what the world
calls eccentricity.</p>

<p>If it be a fact that men of revolutionary aims in politics
or religion, are commonly revolutionists in custom also, it is
not less a fact that those whose office it is to uphold
established arrangements in State and Church, are also
those who most adhere to the social forms and observances
bequeathed to us by past generations. Practices elsewhere
extinct still linger about the head quarters of government.
The monarch still gives assent to Acts of Parliament in the
old French of the Normans; and Norman French terms are
still used in law. Wigs, such as those we see depicted in
old portraits, may yet be found on the heads of judges and
barristers. The Beefeaters at the Tower wear the costume
of Henry VIIth’s body-guard. The University dress of the
present year varies but little from that worn soon after the
Reformation. The claret-coloured coat, knee-breeches,
lace shirt-frills, white silk stockings, and buckled shoes,
which once formed the usual attire of a gentleman, still
survive as the court-dress. And it need scarcely be said
that at <i>levées</i> and drawing-rooms, the ceremonies are prescribed
with an exactness, and enforced with a rigour, not
elsewhere to be found.</p>

<p>Can we consider these two series of coincidences as accidental
and unmeaning? Must we not rather conclude that
some necessary relationship obtains between them? Are
there not such things as a constitutional conservatism, and
a constitutional tendency to change? Is there not a class
which clings to the old in all things; and another class so in
love with progress as often to mistake
novelty for <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
improvement? Do we not find some men ready to bow to established
authority of whatever kind; while others demand of every
such authority its reason, and reject it if it fails to justify
itself? And must not the minds thus contrasted tend to
become respectively conformist and nonconformist, not only
in politics and religion, but in other things? Submission,
whether to a government, to the dogmas of ecclesiastics, or
to that code of behaviour which society at large has set up,
is essentially of the same nature; and the sentiment which
induces resistance to the despotism of rulers, civil or
spiritual, likewise induces resistance to the despotism of the
world’s usages. All enactments, alike of the legislature,
the consistory, and the saloon—all regulations, formal or
virtual, have a common character: they are all limitations
of men’s freedom. “Do this—Refrain from that,” are the
blank forms into which they may severally be written; and
throughout the understanding is that obedience will bring
approbation here and paradise hereafter; while disobedience
will entail imprisonment, or sending to Coventry, or eternal
torments, as the case may be. And if restraints, however
named, and through whatever apparatus of means exercised,
are one in their action upon men, it must happen that those
who are patient under one kind of restraint, are likely to be
patient under another; and conversely, that those impatient
of restraint in general, will, on the average, tend to show
their impatience in all directions.</p>

<p>That Law, Religion, and Manners are thus related, and
that they have in certain contrasted char­ac­ter­is­tics of men
a common support and a common danger, will, however, be
most clearly seen on discovering that they have a common
origin. Little as from present appearances we should
suppose it, we shall yet find that at first, the control of
religion, the control of laws, and the control of manners,
were all one control. Strange as it now seems, we believe
it to be demonstrable that the rules of etiquette, the
provisions of the statute-book, and the
commands of the <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
decalogue, have grown from the same root. If we go far
enough back into the ages of primeval Fetishism, it becomes
manifest that originally Deity, Chief, and Master of the
Ceremonies were identical. To make good these positions,
and to show their bearing on what is to follow, it will be
necessary here to traverse ground that is in part somewhat
beaten, and at first sight irrelevant to our topic. We
will pass over it as quickly as consists with the exigencies
of the argument.</p>

<p class="padtopb">That the earliest social aggregations were ruled solely by
the will of the strong man, few dispute.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn2" id="fnanch2">2</a>
That from the
strong man proceeded not only Monarchy, but the conception
of a God, few admit: much as Carlyle and others have
said in evidence of it. If, however, those who are unable
to believe this, will lay aside the ideas of God and man in
which they have been educated, and study the aboriginal
ideas of them, they will at least see some probability in the
hypothesis. Let them remember that before experience
had yet taught men to distinguish between the possible and
the impossible; and while they were ready on the slightest
suggestion to ascribe unknown powers to any object and
make a fetish of it; their conceptions of humanity and its
capacities were necessarily vague, and without specific
limits. The man who by unusual strength, or cunning,
achieved something that others had failed to achieve, or
something which they did not understand, was considered
by them as differing from themselves; and, as we see in
the belief of some Polynesians that only their chiefs have
souls, or in that of the ancient Peruvians that their nobles
were divine by birth, the ascribed difference was apt to be
not one of degree only, but one of kind. Let them
remember next, how gross were the notions
of God, or <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
rather of gods, prevalent during the same era and afterwards—how
concretely gods were conceived as men of
specific aspects dressed in specific ways—how their names
were literally “the strong,” “the destroyer,” “the powerful
one,”—how, according to the Scandinavian mythology,
the “sacred duty of blood-revenge” was acted on by the
gods themselves,—and how they were not only human in
their vindictiveness, their cruelty, and their quarrels with
each other, but were supposed to have amours on earth,
and to consume the viands placed on their altars. Add to
which, that in various mythologies, Greek, Scandinavian,
and others, the oldest beings are giants; that according to
a traditional genealogy the gods, demi-gods, and in some
cases men, are descended from these after the human
fashion; and that while in the East we hear of sons of God
who saw the daughters of men that they were fair, the
Teutonic myths tell of unions between the sons of men and
the daughters of the gods. Let them remember, too, that
at first the idea of death differed widely from that which
we have; that there are still tribes who, on the decease of
one of their number, attempt to make the corpse stand,
and put food into its mouth; that the Peruvians had feasts
at which the mummies of their dead Incas presided, when,
as Prescott says, they paid attention “to these insensible
remains as if they were instinct with life;” that among the
Fijians it is believed that every enemy has to be killed
twice; that the Eastern Pagans give extension and figure
to the soul, and attribute to it all the same members, all
the same substances, both solid and liquid, of which our
bodies are composed; and that it is the custom among most
barbarous races to bury food, weapons, and trinkets along
with the dead body, under the manifest belief that it will
presently need them. Lastly, let them remember that
the other world, as originally conceived, is simply some
distant part of this world—some Elysian fields, some happy
hunting-ground, accessible even to the living,
and to which, <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
after death, men travel in anticipation of a life analogous
in general character to that which they led before. Then,
co-ordinating these general facts—the ascription of unknown
powers to chiefs and medicine men; the belief in
deities having human forms, passions, and behaviour; the
imperfect comprehension of death as distinguished from
life; and the proximity of the future abode to the present,
both in position and character—let them reflect whether
they do not almost unavoidably suggest the conclusion
that the aboriginal god is the dead chief: the chief not
dead in our sense, but gone away, carrying with him food
and weapons to some rumoured region of plenty, some
promised land, whither he had long intended to lead
his followers, and whence he will presently return to
fetch them. This hypothesis once entertained, is seen to
harmonize with all primitive ideas and practices. The
sons of the deified chief reigning after him, it necessarily
happens that all early kings are held descendants of the
gods; and the fact that alike in Assyria, Egypt, among
the Jews, Phœnicians, and ancient Britons, kings’ names
were formed out of the names of the gods, is fully explained.
The genesis of Polytheism out of Fetishism, by
the successive migrations of the race of god-kings to the
other world—a genesis illustrated in the Greek mythology,
alike by the precise genealogy of the deities, and by the
specifically-asserted apotheosis of the later ones—tends
further to bear it out. It explains the fact that in the old
creeds, as in the still extant creed of the Otaheitans, every
family has its guardian spirit, who is supposed to be one of
their departed relatives; and that they sacrifice to these as
minor gods—a practice still pursued by the Chinese and
even by the Russians. It is perfectly congruous with the
Grecian myths concerning the wars of the Gods with the
Titans and their final usurpation; and it similarly agrees
with the fact that among the Teutonic gods proper was one
Freir who came among them by adoption,
“but was born <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
among the <i>Vanes</i>, a somewhat mysterious <i>other</i> dynasty of
gods, who had been conquered and superseded by the
stronger and more warlike Odin dynasty.” It harmonizes,
too, with the belief that there are different gods to different
territories and nations, as there were different chiefs; that
these gods contend for supremacy as chiefs do; and it
gives meaning to the boast of neighbouring tribes—“Our
god is greater than your god.” It is confirmed by the
notion universally current in early times, that the gods
come from this other abode, in which they commonly live,
and appear among men—speak to them, help them, punish
them. And remembering this, it becomes manifest that
the prayers put up by primitive peoples to their gods for
aid in battle, are meant literally—that their gods are
expected to come back from the other kingdom they are
reigning over, and once more fight the old enemies they
had before warred against so implacably; and it needs but
to name the Iliad, to remind every one how thoroughly they
believed the expectation fulfilled.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn3" id="fnanch3">3</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch2" id="fn2">2</a>
The few who disputed it would be right however. There are stages
preceding that in which chiefly power becomes established; and in many
cases it never does become established.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch3" id="fn3">3</a>
In this paragraph, which I have purposely left
standing word for word as it did when republished with
other essays in Dec. 1857, will be seen the outline of the
ghost-theory. Though there are references to fetishism
as a primitive form of belief, and though at that time I
had passively accepted the current theory (though never
with satisfaction, for the origin of fetishism as then
conceived seemed in­comp­re­hen­si­ble) yet the belief that
inanimate objects may possess supernatural powers (which is
what was then understood as fetishism) is not dwelt upon
as a primitive belief. The one thing which is dwelt upon
is the belief in the double of the dead man as continuing
to exist, and as becoming an object of propitiation and
eventually of worship. There are clearly marked out the
rudiments which, when supplied with the mass of facts
collected in the <i>Descriptive Sociology</i> developed into
the doctrine elaborated in Part I. of <i>The Principles of
Sociology</i>.</p></div>

<p>All government, then, being originally that of the strong
man who has become a fetish by some manifestation of
superiority, there arises, at his death—his supposed departure
on a long-projected expedition, in which he is
accompanied by the slaves and concubines sacrificed at his
tomb—there arises, then, the incipient
division of religious <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
from political control, of spiritual rule from civil. His son
becomes deputed chief during his absence; his authority
is cited as that by which his son acts; his vengeance is
invoked on all who disobey his son; and his commands, as
previously known or as asserted by his son, become the
germ of a moral code: a fact we shall the more clearly
perceive if we remember, that early moral codes inculcate
mainly the virtues of the warrior, and the duty of exterminating
some neighbouring tribe whose existence is an
offence to the deity. From this point onwards, these
two kinds of authority, at first complicated together as
those of principal and agent, become slowly more and
more distinct. As experience accumulates, and ideas of
causation grow more precise, kings lose their supernatural
attributes; and, instead of God-king, become God-descended
king, God-appointed king, the Lord’s anointed,
the vicegerent of Heaven, ruler reigning by Divine right.
The old theory, however, long clings to men in feeling,
after it has disappeared in name; and “such divinity
doth hedge a king,” that even now, many, on first
seeing one, feel a secret surprise at finding him an ordinary
sample of humanity. The sacredness attaching to
royalty attaches afterwards to its appended institutions—to
legislatures, to laws. Legal and illegal are synonymous
with right and wrong; the authority of Parliament is held
unlimited; and a lingering faith in governmental power
continually generates unfounded hopes from its enactments.
Political scepticism, however, having destroyed the divine
<i>prestige</i> of royalty, goes on ever increasing, and promises
ultimately to reduce the State to a purely secular institution,
whose regulations are limited in their sphere, and have no
other authority than the general will. Meanwhile, the
religious control has been little by little separating itself
from the civil, both in its essence and in its forms. While
from the God-king of the barbarian have arisen in one
direction, secular rulers who, age by age,
have been losing <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
the sacred attributes men ascribed to them; there has
arisen in another direction, the conception of a deity, who,
at first human in all things, has been gradually losing
human materiality, human form, human passions, human
modes of action: until now, anthropomorphism has become
a reproach. Along with this wide divergence in men’s
ideas of the divine and civil ruler has been taking place
a corresponding divergence in the codes of conduct
respectively proceeding from them. While the king was a
deputy-god—a governor such as the Jews looked for in the
Messiah—a governor considered, as the Czar still is, “our
God upon earth,”—it, of course, followed that his commands
were the supreme rules. But as men ceased to believe in
his supernatural origin and nature, his commands ceased to
be the highest; and there arose a distinction between the
regulations made by him, and the regulations handed down
from the old god-kings, who were rendered ever more
sacred by time and the accumulation of myths. Hence
came respectively, Law and Morality: the one growing ever
more concrete, the other more abstract; the authority of
the one ever on the decrease, that of the other ever on the
increase; originally the same, but now placed daily in more
marked antagonism. Simultaneously there has been going
on a separation of the institutions administering these two
codes of conduct. While they were yet one, of course
Church and State were one: the king was arch-priest, not
nominally, but really—alike the giver of new commands
and the chief interpreter of the old commands; and the
deputy-priests coming out of his family were thus simply
expounders of the dictates of their ancestry: at first as
recollected, and afterwards as ascertained by professed
interviews with them. This union between sacred and
secular—which still existed practically during the middle
ages, when the authority of kings was mixed up with the
authority of the pope, when there were bishop-rulers having
all the powers of feudal lords, and
when priests punished <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
by penances—has been, step by step, becoming less close.
Though monarchs are still “defenders of the faith,” and
ecclesiastical chiefs, they are but nominally such. Though
bishops still have civil power, it is not what they once had.
Protestantism shook loose the bonds of union; Dissent has
long been busy in organizing a mechanism for religious
control, wholly independent of law; in America, a separate
organization for that purpose already exists; and if anything
is to be hoped from the Anti-State-Church Association—or,
as it has been newly named, “The Society for the
Liberation of Religion from State Patronage and Control”—we
shall presently have a separate organization here also.
Thus, in authority, in essence, and in form, political and
spiritual rule have been ever more widely diverging from
the same root. That increasing division of labour which
marks the progress of society in other things, marks it also
in this separation of government into civil and religious;
and if we observe how the morality which now forms the
substance of religions in general, is beginning to be purified
from the associated creeds, we may anticipate that this
division will be ultimately carried much further.</p>

<p>Passing now to the third species of control—that of
Manners—we shall find that this, too, while it had a common
genesis with the others, has gradually come to have a
distinct sphere and a special embodiment. Among early
aggregations of men before yet social observances existed,
the sole forms of courtesy known were the signs of submission
to the strong man; as the sole law was his will, and
the sole religion the awe of his supposed supernaturalness.
Originally, ceremonies were modes of behaviour to the god-king.
Our commonest titles have been derived from his
names. And all salutations were primarily worship paid to
him. Let us trace out these truths in detail, beginning
with titles.</p>

<p>The fact already noticed, that the names of early kings
among divers races are formed by the
addition of certain <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
syllable to the names of their gods—which certain syllables,
like our <i>Mac</i> and <i>Fitz</i>, probably mean “son of,” or
“descended from”—at once gives meaning to the term
<i>Father</i> as a divine title. And when we read, in Selden,
that “the composition out of these names of Deities was
not only proper to Kings: their Grandees and more honorable
Subjects” (no doubt members of the royal race) “had
sometimes the like;” we see how the term <i>Father</i>, properly
used by these also, and by their multiplying descendants, came
to be a title used by the people in general. As bearing
on this point, it is significant that in the least advanced
country of Europe, where belief in the divine nature of the
ruler still lingers, <i>Father</i> in this higher sense, is still a regal
distinction. When, again, we remember how the divinity
at first ascribed to kings was not a complimentary fiction
but a supposed fact; and how, further, the celestial bodies
were believed to be personages who once lived among men;
we see that the appellations of oriental rulers, “Brother to
the Sun,” &amp;c., were probably once expressive of a genuine
belief; and have simply, like many other things, continued
in use after all meaning has gone out of them. We may
infer, too, that the titles God, Lord, Divinity, were given
to primitive rulers literally—that the <i>nostra divinitas</i>
applied to the Roman emperors, and the various sacred
designations that have been borne by monarchs, down to
the still extant phrase, “Our Lord the King,” are the dead
and dying forms of what were once living facts. From
these names, God, Father, Lord, Divinity, originally belonging
to the God-king, and afterwards to God and the
king, the derivation of our commonest titles of respect is
traceable. There is reason to think that these titles were
originally proper names. Not only do we see among the
Egyptians, where Pharaoh was synonymous with king, and
among the Romans, where to be Cæsar, meant to be
Emperor, that the proper names of the greatest men were
transferred to their successors, and
so became class-names; <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
but in the Scandinavian mythology we may trace a human
title of honour up to the proper name of a divine personage.
In Anglo-Saxon <i>bealdor</i>, or <i>baldor</i>, means <i>Lord</i>; and Balder
is the name of the favourite of Odin’s sons. How these
names of honour became general is easily understood. The
relatives of the primitive kings—the grandees described by
Selden as having names formed on those of the gods, and
shown by this to be members of the divine race—necessarily
shared in the epithets descriptive of superhuman
relationships and nature. Their ever-multiplying offspring
inheriting these, gradually rendered them comparatively
common. And then they came to be applied to every man
of power: partly from the fact that, in those early days
when men conceived divinity simply as a stronger kind of
humanity, great persons could be called by divine epithets
with but little exaggeration; partly from the fact that the
unusually potent were apt to be considered as unrecognised
or illegitimate descendants of “the strong, the destroyer,
the powerful one;” and partly, also, from compliment and
the desire to propitiate. As superstition diminished, this last
became the sole cause. And if we remember that it is the
nature of compliment, to attribute more than is due—that
in the ever widening application of “esquire,” in the perpetual
repetition of “your honour” by the fawning Irishman,
and in the use of the name “gentleman” to any coalheaver
or dustman by the lower classes of London, we have current
examples of the depreciation of titles consequent on compliment—and
that in barbarous times, when the wish to
propitiate was stronger than now, this effect must have been
greater; we shall see that there naturally arose from this
cause an extensive misuse of all early distinctions. Hence the
facts that the Jews called Herod a god; that <i>Father</i>, in its
higher sense, was a term used among them by servants to
masters; that <i>Lord</i> was applicable to any person of worth
and power. Hence, too, the fact that, in the later periods
of the Roman Empire, every man saluted
his neighbour as <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
<i>Dominus</i> or <i>Rex</i>. But it is in the titles of the middle ages,
and in the growth of our modern ones out of them, that the
process is most clearly seen. <i>Herr</i>, <i>Don</i>, <i>Signor</i>, <i>Seigneur</i>,
<i>Señor</i>, were all originally descriptive names of rulers.
By the complimentary use of these names to all who could,
on any pretence, be supposed to merit them, and by
successive descents to still lower grades, they have come
to be common forms of address. At first the phrase in which
a serf accosted his despotic chief, <i>mein Herr</i> is now familiarly
applied in Germany to ordinary people. The Spanish title
<i>Don</i>, once proper to noblemen and gentlemen only, is now
accorded to all classes. So, too, is it with <i>Signor</i> in Italy.
<i>Seigneur</i> and <i>Monseigneur</i>, by contraction in <i>Sieur</i> and
<i>Monsieur</i>, have produced the term of respect claimed by
every Frenchman. And whether <i>Sire</i> be or be not a like
contraction of <i>Signor</i>, it is clear that, as it was borne by
sundry of the ancient feudal lords of France, who, as Selden
says, “affected rather to bee stiled by the name of <i>Sire</i>
than Baron, as <i>Le Sire de Montmorencie</i>, <i>Le Sire de Beaujeu</i>,
and the like,” and as it has been commonly used to
monarchs, our word <i>Sir</i>, which is derived from it, originally
meant lord or king. Thus, too, is it with feminine titles.
<i>Lady</i>, which, according to Horne Tooke, means <i>exalted</i>, and
was at first given only to the few, is now given to all women
of education. <i>Dame</i>, once an honourable name to which,
in old books, we find the epithets of “high-born” and
“stately” affixed, has now, by repeated widenings of its
application, become relatively a term of contempt. And
if we trace the compound of this, <i>ma Dame</i>, through its
contractions—<i>Madam</i>, <i>ma’am</i>, <i>mam</i>, <i>mum</i>, we find that the
“Yes’m” of Sally to her mistress is originally equivalent to
“Yes, my exalted,” or “Yes, your highness.” Throughout,
therefore, the genesis of words of honour has been the same.
Just as with the Jews and with the Romans, has it been
with the modern Europeans. Tracing these everyday names
to their primitive significations of <i>lord</i>
and <i>king</i>, and <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
remembering that in aboriginal societies these were applied
only to the gods and their descendants, we arrive at the
conclusion that our familiar <i>Sir</i> and <i>Monsieur</i> are, in their
primary and expanded meanings, terms of adoration.</p>

<p>Further to illustrate this gradual depreciation of titles,
and to confirm the inference drawn, it may be well to notice
in passing, that the oldest of them have, as might be
expected, been depreciated to the greatest extent. Thus,
<i>Master</i>—a word proved by its derivation, and by the
similarity of the connate words in other languages (Fr.,
<i>maître</i> for <i>maistre</i>; Dutch, <i>meester</i>; Dan., <i>mester</i>; Ger.,
<i>meister</i>) to have been one of the earliest in use for expressing
lordship—has now become applicable to children only,
and, under the modification of “Mister,” to persons next
above the labourer. Again, knighthood, the oldest kind of
dignity, is also the lowest; and Knight Bachelor, which is
the lowest order of knighthood, is more ancient than any
other of the orders. Similarly, too, with the peerage:
Baron is alike the earliest and least elevated of its divisions.
This continual degradation of all names of honour has,
from time to time, made it requisite to introduce new ones
having the distinguishing effects which the originals had
lost by generality of use; just as our habit of misapplying
superlatives has, by gradually destroying their force,
entailed the need for fresh ones. And if, within the last
thousand years, this process has worked results thus marked,
we may readily conceive how, during previous thousands,
the titles of gods and demi-gods came to be used to all
persons exercising power; as they have since come to be
used to persons of respectability.</p>

<p>If from names of honour we turn to phrases of honour,
we find similar facts. The oriental styles of address,
applied to ordinary people—“I am your slave,” “All I
have is yours,” “I am your sacrifice”—attribute to the
individual spoken to the same greatness that <i>Monsieur</i> and
<i>My Lord</i> do: they ascribe to him the
character of an <span class="xxpn" id="p016">{16}</span>
all-powerful ruler, so immeasurably superior to the speaker as
to be his owner. So, likewise, with the Polish expressions
of respect—“I throw myself under your feet,” “I kiss
your feet.” In our now meaningless subscription to a
formal letter—“Your most obedient servant”—the same
thing is visible. Nay, even in the familiar signature
“Yours faithfully,” the “yours,” if interpreted as originally
meant, is the expression of a slave to his master. All
these dead forms were once living embodiments of fact;
were primarily the genuine indications of that submission
to authority which they verbally assert; were afterwards
naturally used by the weak and cowardly to propitiate
those above them; gradually grew to be considered the
due of such; and, by a continually wider misuse, have lost
their meanings, as <i>Sir</i> and <i>Master</i> have done. That, like
titles, they were in the beginning used only to the God-king,
is indicated by the fact that, like titles, they were
subsequently used in common to God and the king.
Religious worship has ever largely consisted of professions
of obedience, of being God’s servants, of belonging to him
to do what he will with. Like titles, therefore, these
common phrases of honour had a devotional origin. Perhaps,
however, it is in the use of the word <i>you</i> as a singular
pronoun that the popularizing of what were once supreme
distinctions is most markedly illustrated. This addressing
of a single individual in the plural, was originally an honour
given only to the highest—was the reciprocal of the imperial
“we” assumed by such. Yet now, by being applied to
successively lower and lower classes, it has become all but
universal. Only by one sect of Christians, and in a few
secluded districts, is the primitive <i>thou</i> still used. And the
<i>you</i>, in becoming common to all ranks, has simultaneously
lost every vestige of the distinction once attaching to it.</p>

<p>But the genesis of Manners out of forms of allegiance and
worship, is above all shown in modes of salutation. Note
first the significance of the word. Among
the Romans, the <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
<i>salutatio</i> was a daily homage paid by clients and inferiors
to their superiors. This was alike the case with civilians
and in the army. The very derivation of our word, therefore,
is suggestive of submission. Passing to particular
forms of obeisance (mark the word again), let us begin with
the Eastern one of baring the feet. This was, primarily,
a mark of reverence, alike to a god and a king. The act
of Moses before the burning bush, and the practice of
Mahometans, who are sworn on the Koran with their shoes
off, exemplify the one employment of it; the custom of the
Persians, who remove their shoes on entering the presence
of their monarch, exemplifies the other. As usual, however,
this homage, paid next to inferior rulers, has descended
from grade to grade. In India it is a common mark of
respect; the lower orders of Turks never enter the presence
of their superiors but in their stockings; and in Japan, this
baring of the feet is an ordinary salutation of man to man.
Take another case. Selden, describing the ceremonies of
the Romans, says:—“For whereas it was usuall either to
kiss the Images of their Gods, or, adoring them, to stand
somewhat off before them, solemnly moving the right hand
to the lips, and then, casting it as if they had cast kisses, to
turne the body on the same hand (which was the right
forme of Adoration), it grew also by custom, first that the
Emperors, being next to Deities, and by some accounted as
Deities, had the like done to them in acknowledgment
of their Greatness.” If, now, we call to mind the awkward
salute of a village school-boy, made by putting his open
hand up to his face and describing a semicircle with his
forearm; and if we remember that the salute thus used as
a form of reverence in country districts, is most likely
a remnant of the feudal times; we shall see reason
for thinking that our common wave of the hand to a
friend across the street, represents what was primarily
a devotional act.</p>

<p>Similarly have originated all forms
of respect depending <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
upon inclinations of the body. Entire prostration is the
aboriginal sign of submission. The passage of Scripture—“Thou
hast put all under his feet,” and that other one, so
suggestive in its anthropomorphism—“The Lord said unto
my Lord, sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine
enemies thy footstool,” imply, what the Assyrian sculptures
bear out, that it was the practice of the ancient god-kings
of the East to trample on the conquered. As there are
existing savages who signify submission by placing the
neck under the foot of the person submitted to, it becomes
obvious that all prostration, especially when accompanied
by kissing the foot, expressed a willingness to be trodden
upon—was an attempt to mitigate wrath by saying, in
signs, “Tread on me if you will.” Remembering, too,
that kissing the foot, as of the Pope and of a saint’s statue,
still continues in Europe to be a mark of extreme reverence;
that prostration to feudal lords was once general,
and that its disappearance must have taken place, not
abruptly, but by gradual change into something else; we
have ground for deriving from these deepest of humiliations
all inclinations of respect: especially as the transition
is traceable. The reverence of a Russian serf, who bends
his head to the ground, and the salaam of the Hindoo, are
abridged prostrations; a bow is a short salaam; a nod is
a short bow. Should any hesitate to admit this conclusion,
then perhaps, on being reminded that the lowest of these
obeisances are common where the submission is most
abject; that among ourselves the profundity of the bow
marks the amount of respect; and lastly, that the bow is
even now used devotionally in our churches—by Catholics
to their altars, and by Protestants at the name of Christ—they
will see sufficient reason for thinking that this salutation
also was originally worship.</p>

<p>The same may be said, too, of the curtsy, or courtesy, as
it is otherwise written. Its derivation from <i>courtoisie</i>,
courteousness, that is, behaviour like that at
court, at once <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
shows that it was primarily the reverence paid to a
monarch. And if we call to mind that falling on the
knees, or on one knee, has been a common obeisance of
subjects to rulers; that in ancient manuscripts and
tapestries, servants are depicted as assuming this attitude
while offering the dishes to their masters at table; and
that this same attitude is assumed towards our own queen
at every presentation; we may infer, what the character of
the curtsy itself suggests, that it is an abridged act of
kneeling. As the word has been contracted from <i>courtoisie</i>
into curtsy; so the motion has been contracted from a
placing of the knee on the floor, to a lowering of the knee
towards the floor. Moreover, when we compare the curtsy
of a lady with the awkward one a peasant girl makes,
which, if continued, would bring her down on both knees,
we may see in this last a remnant of that greater reverence
required of serfs. And when, from considering that simple
kneeling of the West, still represented by the curtsy, we
pass Eastward, and note the attitude of the Mahommedan
worshipper, who not only kneels but bows his head to the
ground, we may infer that the curtsy also, is an evanescent
form of the aboriginal prostration. In further evidence of
this it may be remarked, that there has but recently
disappeared from the salutations of men, an action having
the same proximate derivation with the curtsy. That
backward sweep of the right foot with which the conventional
stage-sailor accompanies his bow—a movement
which prevailed generally in past generations, when “a
bow and a scrape” went together, and which, within the
memory of living persons, was made by boys to their
master when entering school, with the effect of wearing a
hole in the floor—is pretty clearly a preliminary to going
on one knee. A motion so ungainly could never have
been intentionally introduced; even if the artificial introduction
of obeisances were possible. Hence we must
regard it as the remnant of
something antecedent: and <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
that this something antecedent was humiliating may be
inferred from the phrase, “scraping an acquaintance;”
which, being used to denote the gaining of favour by
obsequiousness, implies that the scrape was considered a
mark of servility—that is, of servile position.</p>

<p>Consider, again, the uncovering of the head. Almost
everywhere this has been a sign of reverence, alike in
temples and before potentates; and it yet preserves among
us some of its original meaning. Whether it rains, hails,
or shines, you must keep your head bare while speaking to
the monarch; and no one may keep his hat on in a place
of worship. As usual, however, this ceremony, at first a
submission to gods and kings, has become in process of
time a common civility. Once an acknowledgment of
another’s unlimited supremacy, the removal of the hat is
now a salute accorded to very ordinary persons; and that
uncovering originally reserved for entrance into “the house
of God” or the residence of the ruler, good manners now
dictates on entrance into a labourer’s cottage.</p>

<p>Standing, too, as a mark of respect, has undergone like
extensions in its application. Shown, by the practice in
our churches, to be intermediate between the humiliation
signified by kneeling and the self-respect which sitting
implies, and used at courts as a form of homage when
more active demonstrations of it have been made, this
posture is now employed in daily life to show consideration;
as seen alike in the attitude of a servant before
a master, and in that rising which politeness prescribes on
the entrance of a visitor.</p>

<p>Many other threads of evidence might have been woven
into our argument. As, for example, the significant fact,
that if we trace back our still existing law of primogeniture—if
we consider it as displayed by Scottish clans, in which
not only ownership but government devolved from the
beginning on the eldest son of the eldest—if we look
further back, and observe that the old
titles of lordship, <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
<i>Signor</i>, <i>Seigneur</i>, <i>Señor</i>, <i>Sire</i>, <i>Sieur</i>, all originally mean
senior, or elder—if we go Eastward, and find that <i>Sheick</i>
has a like derivation, and that the Oriental names for
priests, as <i>Pir</i>, for instance, are literally interpreted <i>old
man</i>—if we note in Hebrew records how far back dates
the ascribed superiority of the first-born, how great the
authority of elders, and how sacred the memory of patriarchs—and
if, then, we remember that among divine titles are
“Ancient of Days,” and “Father of Gods and men;”—we
see how completely these facts harmonize with the hypothesis,
that the aboriginal god is the first man sufficiently
great to become a tradition, the earliest whose power and
deeds made him remembered; that hence antiquity unavoidably
became associated with superiority, and age
with nearness in blood to “the powerful one;” that so
there naturally arose that domination of the eldest which
characterizes the history of all the higher races, and that
theory of human degeneracy which even yet survives. We
might further dwell on the facts, that <i>Lord</i> signifies high-born,
or, as the same root gives a word meaning heaven,
possibly heaven-born; that, before it became common, Sir
or <i>Sire</i>, as well as <i>Father</i>, was the distinction of a priest;
that <i>worship</i>, originally worth-ship—a term of respect that
has been used commonly, as well as to magistrates—is
also our term for the act of attributing greatness or worth
to the Deity; so that to ascribe worth-ship to a man is to
worship him. We might make much of the evidence that
all early governments are more or less distinctly theocratic;
and that among ancient Eastern nations even the commonest
forms and customs had religious sanctions. We
might enforce our argument respecting the derivation of
ceremonies, by tracing out the aboriginal obeisance made
by putting dust on the head, which symbolizes putting
the head in the dust; by affiliating the practice found in
certain tribes, of doing another honour by presenting him
with a portion of hair torn from the
head—an act which <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
seems tantamount to saying, “I am your slave;” by
investigating the Oriental custom of giving to a visitor any
object he speaks of admiringly, which is pretty clearly a
carrying out of the compliment, “All I have is yours.”</p>

<p>Without enlarging, however, on these and minor facts,
we venture to think that the evidence assigned is sufficient.
Had the proofs been few, or of one kind, little
faith could have been placed in the inference. But numerous
as they are, alike in the case of titles, in that of
complimentary phrases, and in that of salutes—similar
and simultaneous, too, as the process of depreciation has
been in all of these; the evidences become strong by
mutual confirmation. And when we recollect, also, that
not only have the results of this process been visible in
various nations and in all times, but that they are occurring
among ourselves at the present moment, and that the
causes assigned for previous depreciations may be seen
daily working out others—when we recollect this, it
becomes scarcely possible to doubt that the process has
been as alleged; and that our ordinary words, acts, and
phrases of civility originally expressed submission to
another’s omnipotence.</p>

<p>Thus the general doctrine, that all kinds of government
exercised over men were at first one government—that the
political, the religious, and the ceremonial forms of control
are divergent branches of a general and once indivisible
control—begins to look tenable. When, with the above
facts fresh in mind, we read that in Eastern traditions
Nimrod, among others, figures in all the characters of
hero, king, and divinity—when we turn to the sculptures
exhumed by Mr. Layard, and contemplating in them the
effigies of kings driving over enemies, and adored by prostrate
slaves, then observe how their actions correspond to the
primitive names for gods, “the strong,” “the destroyer,”
“the powerful one”—and when, lastly, we discover that
among races of men still living,
there are current <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
superstitions analogous to those which old records and old
buildings indicate; we begin to realize the probability of
the hypothesis that has been set forth. Representing to
ourselves the conquering chief as figured in ancient myths,
and poems, and ruins; we may see that all rules of conduct
spring from his will. Alike legislator and judge, quarrels
among his subjects are decided by him; and his words
become the Law. Awe of him is the incipient Religion; and
his maxims furnish his first precepts. Submission is made
to him in the forms he prescribes; and these give birth to
Manners. From the first, time developes political allegiance
and the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice; from the second, the
worship of a being whose personality becomes ever more
vague, and the inculcation of precepts ever more abstract;
from the third, forms and names of honour and the rules of
etiquette. In conformity with the law of evolution of all
organized bodies, that general functions are gradually
separated into the special functions constituting them, there
have grown up in the social organism for the better performance
of the governmental office, an apparatus of law-courts,
judges, and barristers; a national church, with its
bishops and priests; and a system of caste, titles, and
ceremonies, administered by society at large. By the
first, overt aggressions are cognized and punished; by
the second, the disposition to commit such aggressions
is in some degree checked; by the third, those minor
breaches of good conduct which the others do not notice,
are denounced and chastised. Law and Religion control
behaviour in its essentials; Manners control it in its details.
For regulating those daily actions which are too numerous
and too unimportant to be officially directed there comes
into play this subtler set of restraints. And when we consider
what these restraints are—when we analyze the words,
and phrases, and movements employed, we see that in
origin as in effect, the system is a setting
up of temporary <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
governments between all men who come in contact, for the
purpose of better managing the intercourse between them.</p>

<p class="padtopb">From the proposition, that these several kinds of
government are essentially one, both in genesis and function, may be
deduced several important corollaries, directly bearing on our special
topic.</p>

<p>Let us first notice, that there is not only a common origin
and office for all forms of rule, but a common necessity for
them. The aboriginal man, coming fresh from the killing
of bears and from lying in ambush for his enemy, has, by
the necessities of his condition, a nature requiring to be
curbed in its every impulse. Alike in war and in the
chase, his daily discipline has been that of sacrificing other
creatures to his own needs and passions. His character,
bequeathed to him by ancestors who led similar lives, is
moulded by this discipline—is fitted to this existence. The
unlimited selfishness, the love of inflicting pain, the blood-thirstiness,
thus kept active, he brings with him into the
social state. These dispositions put him in constant danger
of conflict with his equally savage neighbour. In small
things as in great, in words as in deeds, he is aggressive;
and is hourly liable to the aggressions of others like natured.
Only, therefore, by rigorous control exercised over all
actions, can the primitive unions of men be maintained.
There must be a ruler strong, remorseless, and of indomitable
will; there must be a creed terrible in its threats to
the disobedient; there must be servile submission of inferiors
to superiors. The law must be cruel; the religion must be
stern; the ceremonies must be strict. The co-ordinate
necessity for these several kinds of restraint might be
largely illustrated from history were there space. Suffice
it to point out that where the civil power has been weak,
the multiplication of thieves, assassins, and banditti, has
indicated the approach of social
dissolution; that when, <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
from the corruptness of its ministry, religion has lost its
influence, as it did just before the Flagellants appeared, the
State has been endangered; and that the disregard of
established social observances has ever been an accompaniment
of political revolutions. Whoever doubts the necessity
for a government of manners proportionate in strength to
the co-existing political and religious governments, will be
convinced on calling to mind that until recently even elaborate
codes of behaviour failed to keep gentlemen from
quarrelling in the streets and fighting duels in taverns;
and on remembering that even now people exhibit at the
doors of a theatre, where there is no ceremonial law to rule
them, an aggressiveness which would produce confusion if
carried into social intercourse.</p>

<p>As might be expected, we find that, having a common
origin and like general functions, these several controlling
agencies act during each era with similar degrees of vigour.
Under the Chinese despotism, stringent and multitudinous
in its edicts and harsh in the enforcement of them, and
associated with which there is an equally stern domestic
despotism exercised by the eldest surviving male of the
family, there exists a system of observances alike complicated
and rigid. There is a tribunal of ceremonies.
Previous to presentation at court, ambassadors pass many
days in practising the required forms. Social intercourse
is cumbered by endless compliments and obeisances. Class
distinctions are strongly marked by badges. And if there
wants a definite measure of the respect paid to social
ordinances, we have it in the torture to which ladies submit
in having their feet crushed. In India, and indeed throughout
the East, there exists a like connexion between the
pitiless tyranny of rulers, the dread terrors of immemorial
creeds, and the rigid restraint of unchangeable customs.
Caste regulations continue still unalterable; the fashions
of clothes and furniture have remained the same for ages;
suttees are so ancient as to be mentioned
by Strabo and <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
Diodorus Siculus; justice is still administered at the palace-gates
as of old; in short, “every usage is a precept of
religion and a maxim of jurisprudence.” A similar relationship
of phenomena was exhibited in Europe during the
Middle Ages. While its governments, general and local,
were despotic, while the Church was unshorn of its power,
while the criminal code was full of horrors and the hell of
the popular creed full of terrors, the rules of behaviour
were both more numerous and more carefully conformed to
than now. Differences of dress marked divisions of rank.
Men were limited by law to certain widths of shoe-toes;
and no one below a specified degree might wear a cloak
less than so many inches long. The symbols on banners
and shields were carefully attended to. Heraldry was an
important branch of knowledge. Precedence was strictly
insisted on. And those various salutes of which we now
use the abridgments, were gone through in full. Even
during our own last century, with its corrupt House of
Commons and little-curbed monarchs, we may mark a
correspondence of social formalities. Gentlemen were still
distinguished from lower classes by dress; and children
addressed their parents as <i>Sir</i> and <i>Madam</i>.</p>

<p>A further corollary naturally following this last, and
almost, indeed, forming part of it, is, that these several
kinds of government decrease in stringency at the same
rate. Simultaneously with the decline in the influence of
priesthoods, and in the fear of eternal torments—simultaneously
with the mitigation of political tyranny, the growth
of popular power, and the amelioration of criminal codes;
has taken place that diminution of formalities and that
fading of distinctive marks, now so observable. Looking at
home, we may note that there is less attention to precedence
than there used to be. No one in our day ends an interview
with the phrase “your humble servant.” The employment
of the word <i>Sir</i>, once general in social intercourse, is
at present considered bad breeding; and
on the occasions <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
calling for them, it is held vulgar to use the words “Your
Majesty,” or “Your Royal Highness,” more than once
in a conversation. People no longer formally drink one
another’s healths; and even the taking wine with one
another at dinner has ceased to be fashionable. It is
remarked of us by foreigners, that we take off our hats less
than any other nation in Europe—a remark which should
be coupled with the other, that we are the freest nation in
Europe. As already implied, this association of facts is
not accidental. These modes of address and titles and
obeisances, bearing about them, as they all do, something
of that servility which marks their origin, become distasteful
in proportion as men become more independent themselves,
and sympathize more with the independence of others.
The feeling which makes the modern gentleman tell the
labourer standing bareheaded before him to put on his hat—the
feeling which gives us a dislike to those who cringe
and fawn—the feeling which makes us alike assert our own
dignity and respect that of others—the feeling which thus
leads us more and more to discountenance forms and names
which confess inferiority and submission; is the same feeling
which resists despotic power and inaugurates popular
government, denies the authority of the Church and establishes
the right of private judgment.</p>

<p>A fourth fact, akin to the foregoing, is, that with
decreasing coerciveness in these several kinds of government,
their respective forms lose their meanings. The
same process which has made our monarch put forth as his
own acts what are the acts of ministers approved by the
people, and has thus changed him from master into agent—the
same process which, making attendance at church very
much a matter of respectability, has done away with the
telling of beads, the calling on saints, and the performance
of penances; is a process by which titles and ceremonies
that once had a meaning and a power have been reduced to
empty forms. Coats of arms which
served to distinguish <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
men in battle, now figure on the carriage panels of retired
merchants. Once a badge of high military rank, the
shoulder-knot has become, on the modern footman, a mark
of servitude. The name Banneret, which originally marked
a partially-created Baron—a Baron who had passed his
military “little go”—is now, under the modification of
Baronet, applicable to any one favoured by wealth or interest
or party feeling. Knighthood has so far ceased to be an
honour, that men honour themselves by declining it. The
military dignity <i>Escuyer</i> has, in the modern Esquire,
become a wholly unmilitary affix.</p>

<p>But perhaps it is in that class of social observances comprehended
under the term Fashion (which we must here
discuss parenthetically) that this process is seen with the
greatest distinctness. As contrasted with Manners, which
dictate our minor acts in relation to other persons, Fashion
dictates our minor acts in relation to ourselves. While the
one prescribes that part of our deportment which directly
affects our neighbours; the other prescribes that part of
our deportment which is primarily personal, and in which
our neighbours are concerned only as spectators. Thus
distinguished as they are, however, the two have a common
source. For while, as we have shown, Manners originate
by imitation of the behaviour pursued <i>towards</i> the great;
Fashion originates by imitation of the behaviour <i>of</i> the
great. While the one has its derivation in the titles,
phrases, and salutes used <i>to</i> those in power; the other is
derived from the habits and appearances exhibited <i>by</i> those
in power. The Carrib mother who squeezes her child’s
head into a shape like that of the chief; the young savage
who makes marks on himself similar to the scars carried by
the warriors of his tribe; the Highlander who adopts the
plaid worn by the head of his clan; the courtiers who affect
greyness, or limp, or cover their necks, in imitation of their
king, and the people who ape the courtiers; are alike acting
under a kind of government connate with
that of Manners, <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
and, like it too, primarily beneficial. For notwithstanding
the numberless absurdities into which this copying has led
people, from nose-rings to ear-rings, from painted faces to
beauty-spots, from shaven heads to powdered wigs, from
filed teeth and stained nails to bell-girdles, peaked shoes,
and breeches stuffed with bran, it must yet be concluded
that as the men of will, intelligence, and originality, who
have got to the top, are, on the average, more likely to
show judgment in their habits and tastes than the mass, the
imitation of such is advantageous. By and by, however,
Fashion, decaying like these other forms of rule, almost
wholly ceases to be an imitation of the best, and becomes
an imitation of quite other than the best. As those who
take orders are not those having a special fitness for the
priestly office, but those who hope to get livings; as
legislators and public functionaries do not become such by
virtue of their political insight and power to rule, but by
virtue of birth, acreage, and class influence; so, the self-elected
clique who set the fashion, do this, not by force of
nature, by intellect, by higher worth or better taste, but
solely by unchecked assumption. Among the initiated are
to be found neither the noblest in rank, the chief in power,
the best cultured, the most refined, nor those of greatest
genius, wit, or beauty; and their reunions, so far from being
superior to others, are noted for their inanity. Yet, by the
example of these sham great, and not by that of the truly
great, does society at large now regulate its habits, its
dress, its small usages. As a natural consequence, these
have generally little of that suitableness which the theory of
fashion implies they should have. Instead of a progress
towards greater elegance and convenience, which might be
expected to occur did people copy the ways of the really
best, or follow their own ideas of propriety, we have a reign
of mere whim, of unreason, of change for the sake of change,
of wanton oscillations from either extreme to the other.
And so life <i>à la mode</i>, instead of being life
conducted in the <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
most rational manner, is life regulated by spendthrifts and
idlers, milliners and tailors, dandies and silly women.</p>

<p>To these several corollaries—that the various orders of
control exercised over men have a common origin and a
common function, are called out by co-ordinate necessities
and co-exist in like stringency, decline together and decay
together—it now only remains to add that they simultaneously
become less needful. The social discipline which
has already wrought out great changes in men, must go on
eventually to work out greater ones. That daily curbing
of the lower nature and culture of the higher, which out of
cannibals and devil-worshippers has evolved philanthropists,
lovers of peace, and haters of superstition, may be expected
to evolve out of these, men as much superior to them as
they are to their progenitors. The causes that have
produced past modifications are still in action; must
continue in action as long as there exists any incongruity
between men’s desires and the requirements of the social
state; and must eventually make them organically fit for
the social state. As it is now needless to forbid man-eating,
so will it ultimately become needless to forbid
murder, theft, and the minor offences of our criminal code.
Along with growth of human nature into harmony with the
moral law, there will go decreasing need for judges and
statute-books; when the right course has become the
course spontaneously chosen, prospects of future reward or
punishment will not be wanted as incentives; and when
due regard for others has become instinctive, there will
need no code of ceremonies to say how behaviour shall
be regulated.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Thus, then, may be recognized the meaning of those
eccentricities of reformers which we set out by describing.
They are not accidental; they are not mere personal
caprices. They are inevitable results of the law of relationship
above illustrated. That community
of genesis, function, <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
and decay which all forms of restraint exhibit, is simply
the obverse of the fact at first pointed out, that they have
in two sentiments of human nature a common preserver
and a common destroyer. Awe of power originates and
cherishes them all; love of freedom undermines and
weakens them all. The one defends despotism and asserts
the supremacy of laws, adheres to old creeds and supports
ecclesiastical authority, pays respect to titles and conserves
forms; the other, putting rectitude above legality, achieves
periodical instalments of political liberty, inaugurates Protestantism
and works out its consequences, ignores the
senseless dictates of Fashion and emancipates men from
dead customs. To the true reformer no institution is
sacred, no belief above criticism. Everything shall conform
itself to equity and reason; nothing shall be saved by its
prestige. Conceding to each man liberty to pursue his own
ends and satisfy his own tastes, he demands for himself
like liberty; and consents to no restrictions on this, save
those which other men’s equal claims involve. No matter
whether it be an ordinance of one man, or an ordinance of
all men, if it trenches on his legitimate sphere of action, he
denies its validity. The tyranny that would impose on
him a particular style of dress and a set mode of behaviour,
he resists equally with the tyranny that would limit his
buyings and sellings, or dictate his creed. Whether the
regulation be formally made by a legislature, or informally
made by society at large—whether the penalty for disobedience
be imprisonment, or frowns and social ostracism,
he sees to be a question of no moment. He will utter his
belief notwithstanding the threatened punishment; he will
break conventions spite of the petty persecutions that will
be visited on him. Show him that his actions are inimical
to his fellow-men, and he will pause. Prove that he is
disregarding their legitimate claims, and he will alter his
course. But until you do this—until you demonstrate
that his proceedings are
essentially inconvenient or <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
inelegant, essentially irrational, unjust, or ungenerous, he
will persevere.</p>

<p>Some, indeed, argue that his conduct <i>is</i> unjust and
ungenerous. They say that he has no right to annoy other
people by his whims; that the gentleman to whom his
letter comes with no “Esq.” appended to the address, and
the lady whose evening party he enters with gloveless
hands, are vexed at what they consider his want of respect
or want of breeding; that thus his eccentricities cannot
be indulged save at the expense of his neighbours’
feelings; and that hence his nonconformity is in plain
terms selfishness.</p>

<p>He answers that this position, if logically developed,
would deprive men of all liberty whatever. Each must
conform all his acts to the public taste, and not his own.
The public taste on every point having been once ascertained,
men’s habits must thenceforth remain for ever fixed;
seeing that no man can adopt other habits without sinning
against the public taste, and giving people disagreeable
feelings. Consequently, be it an era of pig-tails or high-heeled
shoes, of starched ruffs or trunk-hose, all must
continue to wear pig-tails, high-heeled shoes, starched
ruffs, or trunk-hose to the crack of doom.</p>

<p>If it be still urged that he is not justified in breaking
through others’ forms that he may establish his own, and
so sacrificing the wishes of many to the wishes of one,
he replies that all religious and political changes might be
negatived on like grounds. He asks whether Luther’s
sayings and doings were not extremely offensive to the
mass of his cotemporaries; whether the resistance of
Hampden was not disgusting to the time-servers around
him; whether every reformer has not shocked men’s
prejudices and given immense displeasure by the opinions
he uttered. The affirmative answer he follows up by
demanding what right the reformer has, then, to utter
these opinions—whether he is not
sacrificing the feelings <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
of many to the feelings of one; and so he proves
that, to be consistent, his antagonists must condemn not
only all nonconformity in actions, but all nonconformity
in beliefs.</p>

<p>His antagonists rejoin that <i>his</i> position, too, may be
pushed to an absurdity. They argue that if a man may
offend by the disregard of some forms, he may as legitimately
do so by the disregard of all; and they inquire—Why
should he not go out to dinner in a dirty shirt, and
with an unshorn chin? Why should he not spit on the
drawing-room carpet, and stretch his heels up to the
mantle-shelf?</p>

<p>The convention-breaker answers, that to ask this, implies
a confounding of two widely-different classes of actions—the
actions which are <i>essentially</i> displeasurable to those
around, with the actions which are but <i>incidentally</i> displeasurable
to them. He whose skin is so unclean as to
offend the nostrils of his neighbours, or he who talks so
loudly as to disturb a whole room, may be justly complained
of, and rightly excluded by society from its assemblies.
But he who presents himself in a surtout in place of a
dress-coat, or in brown trousers instead of black, gives
offence not to men’s senses, or their innate tastes, but
merely to their bigotry of convention. It cannot be said
that his costume is less elegant or less intrinsically appropriate
than the one prescribed; seeing that a few hours
earlier in the day it is admired. It is the implied rebellion,
therefore, which annoys. How little the cause of quarrel
has to do with the dress itself, is seen in the fact that a
century ago black clothes would have been thought preposterous
for hours of recreation, and that a few years
hence some now forbidden style may be nearer the requirements
of Fashion than the present one. Thus the reformer
explains that it is not against the natural restraints, but
against the artificial ones, that he protests; and that
manifestly the fire of angry glances which he
has to bear, <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
is poured upon him because he will not bow down to the
idol which society has set up.</p>

<p>Should he be asked how we are to distinguish between
conduct which is in itself disagreeable to others, and
conduct which is disagreeable by its implication, he
answers, that they will distinguish themselves, if men will
let them. Actions intrinsically repugnant will ever be
frowned upon, and must ever remain as exceptional as
now. Actions not intrinsically repugnant will establish
themselves as proper. No relaxation of customs will
introduce the practice of going to a party in muddy
boots, and with unwashed hands; for the dislike of dirt
would continue were Fashion abolished to-morrow. That
love of approbation which now makes people solicitous to
be <i>en règle</i> would still exist—would still make them careful
of their personal appearance—would still induce them to
seek admiration by making themselves ornamental—would
still cause them to respect the natural laws of good
behaviour, as they now do the artificial laws. The change
would simply be from a repulsive monotony to a picturesque
variety. And if there be any regulations respecting
which it is uncertain whether they are based on reality
or on convention, experiment will soon decide, if due scope
be allowed.</p>

<p>When at length the controversy comes round, as
controversies often do, to the point whence it started, and
the “party of order” repeat their charge against the
rebel, that he is sacrificing the feelings of others to
gratify his own wilfulness, he replies once for all that
they cheat themselves by mis-statements. He accuses
them of being so despotic, that, not content with being
masters over their own ways and habits, they would be
masters over his also; and grumble because he will not let
them. He merely asks the same freedom which they
exercise; they, however, propose to regulate his course as
well as their own—to cut and clip his mode
of life into <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
agreement with their approved pattern; and then charge
him with wilfulness and selfishness, because he does not
quietly submit! He warns them that he shall resist, nevertheless;
and that he shall do so, not only for the assertion
of his own independence, but for their good. He tells
them that they are slaves, and know it not; that they are
shackled, and kiss their chains; that they have lived all
their days in prison, and complain because the walls are
being broken down. He says he must persevere, however,
with a view to his own release; and, in spite of
their present expostulations, he prophesies that when
they have recovered from the fright which the prospect
of freedom produces, they will thank him for aiding in
their emancipation.</p>

<p>Unamiable as seems this find-fault mood, offensive as is
this defiant attitude, we must beware of overlooking the
truths enunciated, in dislike of the advocacy. It is an
unfortunate hindrance to all innovation, that in virtue of
their very function, the innovators stand in a position of
antagonism; and the disagreeable manners, and sayings,
and doings, which this antagonism generates, are commonly
associated with the doctrines promulgated. Quite forgetting
that whether the thing attacked be good or bad, the
combative spirit is necessarily repulsive; and quite forgetting
that the toleration of abuses seems amiable merely
from its passivity; the mass of men contract a bias against
advanced views, and in favour of stationary ones, from
intercourse with their respective adherents. “Conservatism,”
as Emerson says, “is debonnair and social; reform
is individual and imperious.” And this remains true,
however vicious the system conserved, however righteous
the reform to be effected. Nay, the indignation of the
purists is usually extreme in proportion as the evils to
be got rid of are great. The more urgent the required
change, the more intemperate is the vehemence of its
promoters. Let no one, then, confound
with the principles <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
of this social nonconformity the acerbity and the disagreeable
self-assertion of those who first display it.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The most plausible objection raised against resistance to
conventions, is grounded on its impolicy, considered even
from the progressist’s point of view. It is urged by many
of the more liberal and intelligent—usually those who have
themselves shown some independence of behaviour in
earlier days—that to rebel in these small matters is to
destroy your own power of helping on reform in greater
matters. “If you show yourself eccentric in manners or
dress, the world,” they say, “will not listen to you. You
will be considered as crotchety, and impracticable. The
opinions you express on important subjects, which might
have been treated with respect had you conformed on
minor points, will now inevitably be put down among your
singularities; and thus, by dissenting in trifles, you disable
yourself from spreading dissent in essentials.”</p>

<p>Only noting, as we pass, that this is one of those anticipations
which bring about their own fulfilment—that it
is because most who disapprove these conventions do not
show their disapproval, that the few who do show it look
eccentric—and that did all act out their convictions, no such
argument as the above would have force;—noting this as
we pass, we go on to reply that these social restraints are
not small evils but among the greatest. Estimate their
sum total, and we doubt whether they would not exceed
most others. Could we add up the trouble, the cost, the
jealousies, vexations, mis­un­der­stand­ings, the loss of time
and the loss of pleasure, which these conventions entail—we
should perhaps come to the conclusion that the tyranny
of Mrs. Grundy is worse than any other tyranny. Let us
look at a few of its hurtful results; beginning with those of
minor importance.</p>

<p>It produces extravagance. The desire to be <i>comme il
faut</i>, which underlies all conformities,
whether of manners, <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
dress, or styles of entertainment, is the desire which makes
many a spendthrift and many a bankrupt. To “keep up
appearances,” to have a house in an approved quarter
furnished in the latest taste, to give expensive dinners and
crowded <i>soirées</i>, is an ambition forming the natural outcome
of the conformist spirit. It is needless to enlarge on these
follies: they have been satirized by hosts of writers, and
in every drawing-room. All which here concerns us, is to
point out that the respect for social observances, which
men think so praiseworthy, has the same root with this
effort to be fashionable in mode of living; and that, other
things equal, the last cannot be diminished without the
first being diminished also. If, now, we consider what
this extravagance entails—if we count up the robbed
tradesmen, the stinted governesses, the ill-educated children,
the fleeced relatives, who have to suffer from it—if we mark
the anxiety and the many moral delinquencies which its
perpetrators involve themselves in; we shall see that this
regard for conventions is not quite so innocent as it looks.</p>

<p>Again, it decreases the amount of social intercourse.
Passing over the reckless, and those who make a great
display on speculation with the occasional result of getting
on in the world to the exclusion of better men, we come to
the far larger class who, being prudent and honest enough
not to exceed their means, and yet wishing to be “respectable,”
are obliged to limit their entertainments to the
smallest possible number; and that each of these may be
turned to the greatest advantage in meeting the claims on
their hospitality, issue their invitations with little or no
regard to the comfort or mutual fitness of their guests. A
few inconveniently-large assemblies, made up of people
mostly strange to each other or but distantly acquainted,
are made to serve in place of many small parties of friends
intimate enough to have some bond of sympathy. Thus
the quantity of intercourse is diminished, and the quality
deteriorated. Because it is the custom
to make costly <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
preparations and provide costly refreshments; and because
it entails both less expense and less trouble to do this for
many persons on few occasions than for few persons on
many occasions; the reunions of our less wealthy classes
are rendered alike infrequent and tedious.</p>

<p>Let it be further observed, that the existing formalities
of social intercourse drive away many who most need its
refining influence; and drive them into injurious habits
and associations. Not a few men, and not the least sensible
men either, give up in disgust this going out to stately
dinners and stiff evening-parties; and instead, seek society
in clubs, and cigar-divans, and taverns. “I’m sick of this
standing about in drawing-rooms, talking nonsense, and
trying to look happy,” will answer one of them when taxed
with his desertion. “Why should I any longer waste time
and money, and temper? Once I was ready enough to
rush home from the office to dress; I sported embroidered
shirts, submitted to tight boots, and cared nothing for
tailors’ and haberdashers’ bills. I know better now. My
patience lasted a good while; for though I found each night
pass stupidly, I always hoped the next would make amends.
But I’m undeceived. Cab-hire and kid gloves cost more
than any evening party pays for; or rather—it is worth the
cost of them to avoid the party. No, no; I’ll no more of
it. Why should I pay five shillings a time for the privilege
of being bored?” If, now, we consider that this very
common mood tends towards billiard-rooms, towards long
sittings over cigars and brandy-and-water, towards Evans’s
and the Coal Hole; it becomes a question whether these
precise observances which hamper our set meetings, have
not to answer for much of the prevalent dissoluteness.
Men must have excitements of some kind or other; and if
debarred from higher ones will fall back upon lower. It
is not that those who thus take to irregular habits are
essentially those of low tastes. Often it is quite the reverse.
Among half a dozen
intimate friends, abandoning <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
formalities and sitting at ease round the fire, none will enter
with greater enjoyment into the highest kind of social
intercourse—the genuine communion of thought and feeling;
and if the circle includes women of intelligence and
refinement, so much the greater is their pleasure. It is
because they will no longer be choked with the mere dry
husks of conversation which society offers them, that they
fly its assemblies, and seek those with whom they may have
discourse that is at least real, though unpolished. The men
who thus long for substantial mental sympathy, and will go
where they can get it, are often, indeed, much better at the
core than the men who are content with the inanities of
gloved and scented party-goers—men who feel no need to
come morally nearer to their fellow-creatures than they can
come while standing, tea-cup in hand, answering trifles
with trifles; and who, by feeling no such need, prove
themselves shallow-thoughted and cold-hearted. It is true,
that some who shun drawing-rooms do so from inability to
bear the restraints prescribed by a genuine refinement, and
that they would be greatly improved by being kept under
these restraints. But it is not less true that, by adding to
the legitimate restraints, which are based on convenience
and a regard for others, a host of factitious restraints based
only on convention, the refining discipline, which would
else have been borne with benefit, is rendered unbearable,
and so misses its end. Excess of government defeats itself
by driving away those to be governed. And if over all who
desert its entertainments in disgust either at their emptiness
or their formality, society thus loses its salutary influence—if
such not only fail to receive that moral culture which the
company of ladies, when rationally regulated, would give
them, but, in default of other relaxation, are driven into
habits and companionships which often end in gambling
and drunkenness; must we not say that here, too, is an evil
not to be passed over as insignificant?</p>

<p>Then consider what a
blighting effect these <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
multitudinous preparations and ceremonies have upon the
pleasures they profess to subserve. Who, on calling to
mind the occasions of his highest social enjoyments, does
not find them to have been wholly informal, perhaps
impromptu? How delightful a pic-nic of friends, who
forget all observances save those dictated by good nature!
How pleasant the unpretending gatherings of small book-societies,
and the like; or those purely accidental meetings
of a few people well known to each other! Then, indeed,
we may see that “a man sharpeneth the countenance of
his friend.” Cheeks flush, and eyes sparkle. The witty
grow brilliant, and even the dull are excited into saying
good things. There is an overflow of topics; and the
right thought, and the right words to put it in, spring
up unsought. Grave alternates with gay: now serious
converse, and now jokes, anecdotes, and playful raillery.
Everyone’s best nature is shown; everyone’s best feelings
are in pleasurable activity; and, for the time, life seems
well worth having. Go now and dress for some half-past
eight dinner, or some ten o’clock “at home;” and present
yourself in spotless attire, with every hair arranged to perfection.
How great the difference! The enjoyment seems
in the inverse ratio of the preparation. These figures, got
up with such finish and precision, appear but half alive.
They have frozen each other by their primness; and your
faculties feel the numbing effects of the atmosphere the
moment you enter it. All those thoughts, so nimble and
so apt awhile since, have disappeared—have suddenly
acquired a preternatural power of eluding you. If you
venture a remark to your neighbour, there comes a trite
rejoinder, and there it ends. No subject you can hit upon
outlives half a dozen sentences. Nothing that is said
excites any real interest in you; and you feel that all you
say is listened to with apathy. By some strange magic,
things that usually give pleasure seem to have lost all
charm. You have a taste for art.
Weary of frivolous <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
talk, you turn to the table, and find that the book of
engravings and the portfolio of photographs are as flat as
the conversation. You are fond of music. Yet the singing,
good as it is, you hear with utter indifference; and say
“Thank you” with a sense of being a profound hypocrite.
Wholly at ease though you could be, for your own part,
you find that your sympathies will not let you. You see
young gentlemen feeling whether their ties are properly
adjusted, looking vacantly round, and considering what
they shall do next. You see ladies sitting disconsolately,
waiting for some one to speak to them, and wishing they
had the wherewith to occupy their fingers. You see the
hostess standing about the doorway, keeping a factitious
smile on her face, and racking her brain to find the requisite
nothings with which to greet her guests as they enter.
You see numberless traits of weariness and embarrassment;
and, if you have any fellow feeling, these cannot fail to
produce a sense of discomfort. The disorder is catching;
and do what you will, you cannot resist the general
infection. You struggle against it; you make spasmodic
efforts to be lively; but none of your sallies or your good
stories do more than raise a simper or a forced laugh:
intellect and feeling are alike asphyxiated. And when, at
length, yielding to your disgust, you rush away, how great
is the relief when you get into the fresh air, and see the
stars! How you “Thank God, that’s over!” and half
resolve to avoid all such boredom for the future! What,
now, is the secret of this perpetual miscarriage and disappointment?
Does not the fault lie with these needless
adjuncts—these elaborate dressings, these set forms, these
expensive preparations, these many devices and arrangements
that imply trouble and raise expectation? Who
that has lived thirty years in the world has not discovered
that Pleasure is coy; and must not be too directly pursued,
but must be caught unawares? An air from a street-piano,
heard while at work, will often gratify
more than the <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
choicest music played at a concert by the most accomplished
musicians. A single good picture seen in a dealer’s
window, may give keener enjoyment than a whole exhibition
gone through with catalogue and pencil. By the
time we have got ready our elaborate apparatus by which
to secure happiness, the happiness is gone. It is too subtle
to be contained in these receivers, garnished with compliments,
and fenced round with etiquette. The more we
multiply and complicate appliances, the more certain are
we to drive it away. The reason is patent enough. These
higher emotions to which social intercourse ministers, are
of extremely complex nature; they consequently depend
for their production upon very numerous conditions; the
more numerous the conditions, the greater the liability that
one or other of them will not be fulfilled. It takes a
considerable misfortune to destroy appetite; but cordial
sympathy with those around may be extinguished by a look
or a word. Hence it follows, that the more multiplied the
<i>unnecessary</i> requirements with which social intercourse is
surrounded, the less likely are its pleasures to be achieved.
It is difficult enough to fulfil continuously all the <i>essentials</i>
to a pleasurable communion with others: how much more
difficult, then, must it be continuously to fulfil a host of
<i>non-essentials</i> also! What chance is there of getting any
genuine response from the lady who is thinking of your
stupidity in taking her in to dinner on the wrong arm?
How are you likely to have agreeable converse with the
gentleman who is fuming internally because he is not
placed next to the hostess? Formalities, familiar as they
may become, necessarily occupy attention—necessarily
multiply the occasions for mistake, misunderstanding, and
jealousy, on the part of one or other—necessarily distract
all minds from the thoughts and feelings which should
occupy them—necessarily, therefore, subvert those conditions
under which only any sterling intercourse is to be had.</p>

<p>And this, indeed, is the fatal
mischief which these <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
conventions entail—a mischief to which every other is
secondary. They destroy those pleasures which they profess
to subserve. All institutions are alike in this, that
however useful, and needful even, they originally were, they
in the end cease to be so, but often become detrimental.
While humanity is growing, they continue fixed; daily get
more mechanical and unvital; and by and by tend to
strangle what they before preserved. Old forms of government
finally grow so oppressive, that they must be thrown
off even at the risk of reigns of terror. Old creeds end
in being dead formulas, which no longer aid but distort
and arrest the general mind; while the State-churches
administering them, come to be instruments for subsidizing
conservatism and repressing progress. Old schemes of
education, incarnated in public schools and colleges, continue
filling the heads of new generations with what has
become relatively useless knowledge, and, by consequence,
excluding knowledge which is useful. Not an organization
of any kind—political, religious, literary, philanthropic—but
what, by its ever-multiplying regulations, its accumulating
wealth, its yearly addition of officers, and the
creeping into it of patronage and party feeling, eventually
loses its original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism,
worked with a view to private ends—a mechanism which
not merely fails of its first purpose, but is a positive hindrance
to it. Thus is it, too, with social usages. We read
of the Chinese that they have “ponderous ceremonies
transmitted from time immemorial,” which make social
intercourse a burden. The court forms prescribed by
monarchs for their own exaltation, have, in all times and
places, ended in consuming the comfort of their lives.
And so the artificial observances of the dining-room and
saloon, in proportion as they are many and strict, extinguish
that agreeable communion which they were intended to
secure. The dislike with which people commonly speak of
society that is “formal,” and
“stiff,” and “ceremonious,” <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
implies a general recognition of this fact; and this recognition
involves the inference that all usages of behaviour
which are not based on natural requirements, are injurious.
That these conventions defeat their own ends is no new
assertion. Swift, criticising the manners of his day, says—“Wise
men are often more uneasy at the over-civility of
these refiners than they could possibly be in the conversation
of peasants and mechanics.”</p>

<p>But it is not only in these details that the self-defeating
action of our arrangements is traceable; it is traceable in
the very substance and nature of them. Our social intercourse,
as commonly managed, is a mere semblance of the
reality sought. What is it that we want? Some sympathetic
converse with our fellow-creatures:—some converse that
shall not be mere dead words, but the vehicle of living
thoughts and feelings—converse in which the eyes and the
face shall speak, and the tones of the voice be full of meaning—converse
which shall make us feel no longer alone,
but shall draw us closer to others, and double our own
emotions by adding their’s to them. Who is there that
has not, from time to time, felt how cold and flat is all this
talk about politics and science, and the new books and the
new men, and how a genuine utterance of fellow-feeling
outweighs the whole of it? Mark the words of Bacon:—“For
a crowd is not company, and faces are but a gallery
of pictures, and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where there is
no love.” If this be true, then it is only after acquaintance
has grown into intimacy, and intimacy has ripened into
friendship, that the real communion which men need
becomes possible. A rationally-formed circle must consist
almost wholly of those on terms of familiarity and regard,
with but one or two strangers. What folly, then, underlies
the whole system of our grand dinners, our “at homes,” our
evening parties—crowds made up of many who never met
before, many who just bow to one another, many who
though well known feel mutual indifference, with
just a few <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
real friends lost in the general mass! You need but look
round at the artificial expressions of face, to see at once how
it is. All have their disguises on; and how can there be
sympathy between masks? No wonder that in private every
one exclaims against the stupidity of these gatherings. No
wonder that hostesses get them up rather because they
must than because they wish. No wonder that the
invited go less from the expectation of pleasure than
from fear of giving offence. The whole thing is an
organized disappointment.</p>

<p>And then note, lastly, that in this case, as in others,
an organization inoperative for its proper purpose, it is
employed for quite other purposes. What is the usual
plea put in for giving and attending these tedious assemblies?
“I admit that they are dull and frivolous enough,”
replies every man to your criticisms; “but then, you know,
one must keep up one’s connexions.” And could you get
from his wife a sincere answer, it would be—“Like you, I
am sick of these formal parties; but then, we must get our
daughters married.” The one knows that there is a
profession to push, a business to extend; or parliamentary
influence, or county patronage, or votes, or office, to
be got: position, berths, favours, profit. The other’s
thoughts run upon husbands and settlements, wives and
dowries. Worthless for their ostensible purpose of daily
bringing human beings into pleasurable relations with
each other, these cumbrous appliances of our social intercourse
are now perseveringly kept in action with a view
to the pecuniary and matrimonial results which they
indirectly produce.</p>

<p>Who then shall say that the reform of our system of
observances is unimportant? When we see how this system
induces fashionable extravagance, with its occasional ruin—when
we mark how greatly it limits the amount of social
intercourse among the less wealthy classes—when we find
that many who most need to be
disciplined by mixing <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
with the refined are driven away by it, and led into bad
courses—when we count up the many minor evils it inflicts,
the extra work which its costliness entails on all professional
and mercantile men, the damage to public taste
in dress and decoration by the setting up of its absurdities
as standards for imitation, the injury to health indicated
in the faces of its devotees at the close of the London season,
the mortality of milliners and the like, which its sudden
exigencies yearly involve;—and when to all these we add
its fatal sin, that it withers up and kills that high enjoyment
it professedly ministers to—shall we not conclude that
to rationalize etiquette and fashion, is an aim yielding to
few in urgency?</p>

<p class="padtopb">There needs, then, a protestantism in social usages.
Forms which have ceased to facilitate and have become
obstructive—have to be swept away. Signs are not
wanting that some change is at hand. A host of satirists,
led on by Thackeray, have long been engaged in bringing
our sham-festivities, and our fashionable follies, into contempt;
and in their candid moods, most men laugh at the
frivolities with which they and the world in general are
deluded. Ridicule has always been a revolutionary agent.
Institutions that have lost their roots in men’s respect and
faith are doomed; and the day of their dissolution is not
far off. The time is approaching, then, when our system of
social observances must pass through some crisis, out of
which it will come purified and comparatively simple.</p>

<p>How this crisis will be brought about, no one can say.
Whether by the continuance and increase of individual
protests, or whether by the union of many persons for the
practice and diffusion of better usages, the future alone
can decide. The influence of dissentients acting without
co-operation, seems inadequate. Frowned on by conformists,
and expostulated with even by those who secretly
sympathize with them; subject to
petty persecutions, and <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
unable to trace any benefit produced by their example;
they are apt, one by one, to give up their attempts as
hopeless. The young convention-breaker eventually finds
that he pays too heavily for his nonconformity. Hating,
for example, everything that bears about it any remnant
of servility, he determines, in the ardour of his independence,
that he will uncover to no one. But what he means
simply as a general protest, he finds that ladies interpret
into a personal disrespect. In other cases his courage
fails him. Such of his un­con­ven­tional­i­ties as can be attributed
only to eccentricity, he has no qualms about; for, on
the whole, he feels rather complimented than otherwise in
being considered a disregarder of public opinion. But
when they are liable to be put down to ignorance, to ill-breeding,
or to poverty, he becomes a coward. However
clearly the recent innovation of eating some kinds of fish
with knife and fork proves the fork-and-bread practice to
have had little but caprice for its basis, yet he dares not
wholly ignore that practice while fashion partially maintains
it.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn4" id="fnanch4">4</a>
Though he thinks that a silk handkerchief is
quite as appropriate for drawing-room use as a white
cambric one, he is not altogether at ease in acting out his
opinion. Then, too, he begins to perceive that his resistance
to prescription brings round disadvantageous results
which he had not calculated upon. He had expected that
it would save him from a great deal of social intercourse
of a frivolous kind—that it would offend the silly people,
but not the sensible people; and so would serve as a self-acting
test by which those worth knowing would be separated
from those not worth knowing. But the silly people
prove to be so greatly in the majority that, by offending
them, he closes against himself nearly all the avenues
through which the sensible people are to be reached. Thus
he finds, that his nonconformity is frequently misinterpreted;
that there are but few directions in
which he dares <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
to carry it consistently out; that the disadvantages it
entails are greater than he anticipated; and that the
chances of his doing any good are very remote. Hence he
gradually loses resolution, and lapses, step by step, into the
ordinary routine of observances.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch4" id="fn4">4</a>
This was written before the introduction
of silver fish-knives.</p></div>

<p>Abortive as individual protests thus generally turn out,
it may possibly be that nothing effectual will be done until
there arises some organized resistance to this invisible
despotism, by which our modes and habits are dictated.
It may happen, that the government of Manners and
Fashion will be rendered less tyrannical, as the political and
religious governments have been, by some antagonistic
union. Alike in Church and State, men’s first emancipations
from excesses of restriction were achieved by
numbers, bound together by a common creed or a common
political faith. What remained undone while there were
but individual schismatics or rebels, was effected when
there came to be many acting in concert. It is tolerably
clear that these earliest instalments of freedom could not
have been obtained in any other way; for so long as the
feeling of personal independence was weak and the rule
strong, there could never have been a sufficient number of
separate dissentients to produce the desired results. Only
in these later times, during which the secular and spiritual
controls have been growing less coercive, and the tendency
towards individual liberty greater, has it become possible
for smaller and smaller sects and parties to fight against
established creeds and laws; until now men may safely
stand even alone in their antagonism. The failure of
individual nonconformity to customs, suggests that an
analogous series of changes may have to be gone through
in this case also. It is true that the <i>lex non scripta</i> differs
from the <i>lex scripta</i> in this, that, being unwritten, it is
more readily altered; and that it has, from time to time,
been quietly ameliorated. Nevertheless, we shall find that
the analogy holds substantially good. For in
this case, as <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
in the others, the essential revolution is not the substituting
of any one set of restraints for any other, but the limiting
or abolishing the authority which prescribes restraints.
Just as the fundamental change inaugurated by the
Reformation, was not a superseding of one creed by
another, but an ignoring of the arbiter who before dictated
creeds—just as the fundamental change which Democracy
long ago commenced, was not from this particular law to
that, but from the despotism of one to the freedom of all;
so, the parallel change yet to be wrought out in this
supplementary government of which we are treating, is not
the replacing of absurd usages by sensible ones, but the
dethronement of that power which now imposes our usages,
and the assertion of the rights of individuals to choose
their own usages. In rules of living, a West-end clique is
our Pope; and we are all papists, with but a mere sprinkling
of heretics. On those who decisively rebel, comes
down the penalty of excommunication, with its long
catalogue of disagreeable and, indeed, serious consequences.
The liberty of the subject asserted in our constitution, and
ever on the increase, has yet to be wrested from this
subtler tyranny. The right of private judgment, which
our ancestors wrung from the church, remains to be
claimed from this dictator of our habits. Or, as before
said, to free us from these idolatries and superstitious
conformities, there has still to come a protestantism in
social usages. Parallel, therefore, as is the change to be
wrought out, it seems not improbable that it may be
wrought out in an analogous way. That influence which
solitary dissentients fail to gain, and that perseverance
which they lack, may come into existence when they unite.
That persecution which the world now visits upon them
from mistaking their nonconformity for ignorance or disrespect,
may diminish when it is seen to result from
principle. The penalty which exclusion now entails may
disappear when they become numerous
enough to form <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
visiting circles of their own. And when a successful stand
has been made, and the brunt of the opposition has passed,
that large amount of secret dislike to our observances
which now pervades society, may manifest itself with
sufficient power to effect the desired emancipation.</p>

<p>Whether such will be the process, time alone can decide.
That community of origin, growth, supremacy, and decadence,
which we have found among all kinds of government,
suggests a community in modes of change also.
On the other hand, Nature often performs substantially
similar operations, in ways apparently different. Hence
these details can never be foretold.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Meanwhile, let us glance at the conclusions that have
been reached. On the one side, government, originally
one, and afterwards subdivided for the better fulfilment of
its function, must be considered as having ever been, in all
its branches—political, religious, and ceremonial—beneficial;
and, indeed, absolutely necessary. On the other
side, government, under all its forms, must be regarded as
subserving an office, made needful by the unfitness of
aboriginal humanity for social life; and the successive
diminutions of its coerciveness in State, in Church, and in
Custom, must be looked upon ac­com­pa­ny­ing the increasing
adaptation of humanity to its conditions. To complete the
conception, there requires to be borne in mind the third fact,
that the genesis, the maintenance, and the decline of all
governments, however named, are alike brought about by
the humanity to be controlled; from which may be drawn the
inference that, on the average, restrictions of every kind
cannot last much longer than they are wanted, and cannot
be destroyed much faster than they ought to be. Society,
in all its developments, undergoes the process of exuviation.
These old forms which it successively throws off, have all
been once vitally united with it—have severally served as
the protective envelopes within which
a higher humanity <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
was being evolved. They are cast aside only when they
become hindrances—only when some inner and better
envelope has been formed; and they bequeath to us all that
there was in them of good. The periodical abolitions of
tyrannical laws have left the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice not
only uninjured, but purified. Dead and buried creeds
have not carried with them the essential morality they
contained, which still exists, uncontaminated by the sloughs
of superstition. And all that there is of justice and
kindness and beauty, embodied in our cumbrous forms of
etiquette, will live perennially when the forms themselves
have been forgotten.</p>

<p>Believers in the intrinsic virtues of political forms, might
draw an instructive lesson from the politics of our railways.
If there needs a conclusive proof that the most carefully-framed
constitutions are worthless, unless they be embodiments
of the popular character—if there needs a conclusive
proof, that governmental arrangements in advance of the
time will inevitably lapse into congruity with the time;
such proof may be found over and over again repeated in
the current history of joint-stock enterprises. As devised
by Act of Parliament, the ad­min­i­stra­tions of our public
companies are almost purely democratic. The rep­re­sen­ta­tive
system is carried out in them with scarcely a check.
Shareholders elect their directors, directors their chairman;
there is an annual retirement of a certain proportion of
members of the board, giving facilities for superseding
them; and, by this means, the whole ruling body may be
changed in periods varying from three to five years. Yet,
not only are the characteristic vices of our political state
reproduced in each of these mercantile corporations—some
even in an intenser degree—but the very form of government,
while remaining nominally democratic, is substantially
so remodelled as to become a miniature of our national
constitution. The direction, ceasing to fulfil its
theory as a <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
council formed of members who possess equal powers, falls
under the control of some one member of superior cunning,
will, or wealth, to whom the majority become so subordinate,
that the decision on every question depends on the course
he takes. Proprietors, instead of constantly exercising
their franchise, allow it to become on all ordinary occasions
a dead letter. Retiring directors are so habitually re-elected
without opposition, and have so great a power of insuring
their own election when opposed, that the board becomes
practically a close body; and it is only when the misgovernment
grows extreme enough to produce a revolutionary
agitation among the shareholders, that any change
can be effected. Thus, a mixture of the monarchic, the
aristocratic, and the democratic elements, is repeated with
such modifications only as the circumstances involve. The
modes of action, too, are substantially the same; save in
this, that the copy outruns the original. Threats of
resignation, which ministries hold out in extreme cases,
are commonly made by railway-boards to stave off disagreeable
inquiries. By no means regarding themselves as
servants of the shareholders, directors rebel against dictation
from them; and construe any amendment to their proposals
into a vote of want of confidence. At half-yearly meetings,
disagreeable criticisms and objections are met by the chairman
with the remark, that if the shareholders cannot trust
his colleagues and himself, they had better choose others.
With most, this assumption of offended dignity tells; and,
under fear that the company’s interests may suffer from
any disturbance, measures quite at variance with the wishes
of the proprietary are allowed to be carried. The parallel
holds yet further. If it be true of national ad­min­i­stra­tions,
that those in power have the support of public <i>employés</i>;
it is not less true of incorporated companies, that the
directors are aided by the officials in their struggles with
shareholders. If, in times past, there have been ministries
who spent public money to secure party ends;
there are, in <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
times present, railway-boards who use the funds of the
shareholders to defeat the shareholders. Nay, even in
detail, the similarity is maintained. Like their prototype,
joint-stock companies have their expensive election contests,
managed by election committees, employing election
agents; they have their canvassing with its sundry
illegitimate accompaniments; they have their occasional
manufacture of fraudulent votes. And, as a general result,
that class-legislation, which has been habitually charged
against statesmen, is now habitually displayed in the
proceedings of these trading associations: constituted
though they are on purely rep­re­sen­ta­tive principles.</p>

<p>These last assertions will surprise not a few. The
general public who never see a railway-journal, and who
skip the reports of half-yearly meetings which appear in
the daily papers, are under the impression that dishonesties
like those gigantic ones so notorious during the mania, are
no longer committed. They do not forget the doings of
stags and stock-jobbers and runaway-directors. They
remember how men-of-straw held shares amounting to
£100,000, and even £200,000; how numerous directorates
were filled by the same persons—one having a seat at
twenty-three boards; how sub­scrip­tion-con­tracts were
made up with signatures bought at 10<i>s</i> and even 4<i>s</i> each,
and porters and errand-boys made themselves liable for
£30,000 and £40,000 a-piece. They can narrate how
boards kept their books in cipher, made false registries,
and refrained from recording their proceedings in minute-books;
how in one company, half-a-million of capital was
put down to unreal names; how in another, directors
bought for account more shares than they issued, and so
forced up the price; and how in many others, they repurchased
for the company their own shares, paying
themselves with the depositors’ money. But, though more
or less aware of the iniquities which have been practised,
the generality think of them solely
as the accompaniments <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
of bubble schemes. More recent enterprises they know to
have been <i>bonâ fide</i> ones, mostly carried out by old-established
companies; and knowing this, they do not suspect
that in the getting-up of branch lines and extensions,
there are chicaneries near akin to those of Capel Court;
and quite as disastrous in their ultimate results. Associating
the ideas of wealth and respectability, and habitually
using respectability as synonymous with morality, it seems
to them incredible that many of the large capitalists and
men of station who administer railway affairs, should be
guilty of indirectly enriching themselves at the expense
of their constituents. True, they occasionally meet with
a law-report disclosing some enormous fraud; or read a
<i>Times</i> leader, characterising directorial acts in terms
which are held libellous. But they regard the cases thus
brought to light as entirely exceptional; and, under that
feeling of loyalty which ever idealises men in authority,
they constantly tend towards the conviction, if not that
directors can do no wrong, yet that they are very unlikely to
do wrong.</p>

<p>A history of railway management and railway intrigue,
however, would quickly undeceive them. In such a history,
the tricks of projectors and the mysteries of the share-market
would occupy less space than the analysis of the
multiform dishonesties which have been committed since
1845, and the genesis of that elaborate system of tactics by
which companies are betrayed into ruinous undertakings
which benefit the few at the cost of the many. Such a
history would not only have to detail the doings of the
personage famed for “making things pleasant;” nor would
it have merely to add the misdeeds of his colleagues; but
it would have to describe the kindred corruptness of other
railway ad­min­i­stra­tions. From the published report of an
investigation-committee, it would be shown how, not many
years since, the directors of one of our lines allotted among
themselves 15,000 new shares then at a
premium in the <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span>
market; how to pay the deposits on these shares they used
the company’s funds; and how one of their number thus
accommodated himself in meeting both deposits and calls
to the extent of more than £80,000. We should read in
it of one railway chairman who, with the secretary’s connivance,
retained shares exceeding a quarter of a million
in amount, intending to claim them as his allotment if
they rose to a premium; and who, as they did not do
so, left them as unissued shares on the hands of the
proprietors, to their vast loss. We should also read
in it of directors who made loans to themselves out of
the company’s floating balances at a low rate of interest,
when the market rate was high; and who paid themselves
larger salaries than those assigned: entering the difference
in an obscure corner of the ledger under the head of
“petty disbursements.” There would be a description of
the manœuvres by which a delinquent board, under impending
investigation, gets a favourable committee nominated—“a
whitewashing committee.” There would be documents
showing that the proxies enabling boards to carry contested
measures, have in some cases been obtained by garbled
statements; and, again, that proxies given for a specified
purpose have been used for other purposes. One of our
companies would be proved to have projected a line, serving
as a feeder, for which it obtained shareholders by offering a
guaranteed dividend, which, though understood by the public
to be unconditional, was really contingent upon a condition
not likely to be fulfilled. The managers of another company
would be convicted of having carried party measures by the
aid of preference-shares standing in the names of station-masters;
and of being aided by the proxies of the secretary’s
children too young to write.</p>

<p>That the corruptions here glanced at are not exceptional
evils, but result from some deep-seated vice in our system
of railway-government, is sufficiently proved by the fact,
that notwithstanding the
falling of railway-dividends <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
produced by the extension policy, that policy has been year
after year continued. Does any tradesman, who, having
enlarged his shop, finds a proportionate diminution in
his rate of profits, go on, even under the stimulus of
competition, making further enlargements at the risk of
further diminutions? Does any merchant, however strong
his desire to take away an opponent’s markets, make successive
mortgages on his capital, and pay for each sum thus
raised a higher interest than he gains by trading with it?
Yet this course, so absurd that no one would insult a private
individual by asking him to follow it, is the course which
railway-boards, at meeting after meeting, persuade their
clients to pursue. Since 1845, when the dividends of our
leading lines ranged from 8 to 10 per cent., they have,
notwithstanding an ever-growing traffic, fallen from 10 per
cent. to 5, from 8 to 4, from 9 to
3&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>&#xfeff;;
and yet the system
of extensions, leases, and guarantees, notoriously the
cause of this, has been year by year persevered in. Is
there not something needing explanation here—something
more than the world is allowed to see? If there be any
one to whom the broad fact of obstinate persistence in
unprofitable expenditure does not alone carry the conviction
that sinister influences are at work, let him read the seductive
statements by which shareholders are led to authorize new
projects, and then compare these with the proved results.
Let him look at the estimated cost, anticipated traffic, and
calculated dividend on some proposed branch line; let him
observe how the proprietary before whom the scheme is laid,
are induced to approve it as promising a fair return; and
then let him contemplate, in the resulting depreciation of
stock, the extent of their loss. Is there any avoiding the
inference? Railway-shareholders can never have habitually
voted for new undertakings which they knew would be injurious
to them. Every one knows, however, that these new
undertakings have almost uniformly proved injurious to
them. Obviously, therefore,
railway-shareholders have been <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
continually deluded by false representations. The only
possible escape from this conclusion is in the belief that
boards and their officers have been themselves deceived;
and were the discrepancies between promises and results
occasional only, there would be grounds for this lenient
interpretation. But to suppose that a railway-government
should repeatedly make such mistakes, and yet gain no
wisdom from disastrous experiences—should after a dozen
disappointments again mislead half-yearly meetings by
bright anticipations into dark realities, and all in good
faith—taxes credulity somewhat too far. Even, then,
were there no demonstrated iniquities to rouse suspicion,
we think that the continuous depreciation in the value
of railway-stock, the determined perseverance of boards in
the policy which has produced this depreciation, and the
proved untruth of the statements by which they have
induced shareholders to sanction this policy, would of
themselves suffice to show the viciousness of
rail­way-ad­min­i­stra­tion.</p>

<p>That the existing evils, and the causes conspiring to
produce them, may be better understood, it will be needful
to glance at the mode in which the system of extensions
grew up. Earliest among the incentives to it was a feeling
of rivalry. Even while yet their main lines were unfinished,
a contest for supremacy arose between our two greatest
companies. This presently generated a confirmed antagonism;
and the same impulse which in election contests has
sometimes entailed the squandering of a fortune to gain a
victory, has largely aided to make each of these great rivals
submit to repeated sacrifices rather than be beaten. Feuds
of like nature are in other cases perpetually prompting
boards to make aggressions on each other’s territories—every
attack on the one side leading to a reprisal on the
other; and so violent is the hostility occasionally produced,
that directors might be pointed out whose votes are wholly
determined by the desire to be revenged
on their opponents. <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
Among the first methods used by leading companies to
strengthen themselves and weaken their competitors, was
the leasing or purchase of subordinate neighbouring lines.
Of course those to whom overtures were made, obtained
bids from both sides; and it naturally resulted that the
first sales thus effected, being at prices far above the real
values, brought great profits to the sellers. What resulted?
A few recurrences of this proceeding, made it clear to
quick-witted speculators, that constructing lines so circumstanced
as to be bid for by competing companies, would be
a lucrative policy. Shareholders who had once pocketed
these large and easily-made gains, were eager to repeat the
process; and cast about for districts in which it might be
done. Even the directors of the companies by whom these
high prices were given, were under the temptation to aid in
this; for it was manifest to them that by obtaining a larger
interest in any such new undertaking than they possessed
in the purchasing company, and by using their influence in
the purchasing company to obtain a good price or guarantee
for the new undertaking, a great advantage would be
gained. That this motive has been largely operative, railway
history abundantly proves. Once commenced, sundry
other influences conspired to stimulate this making of
feeders and extensions. The non-closure of capital-accounts
rendered possible the “cooking” of dividends, which was
at one period carried to a great extent. Expenditure that
should have been charged against revenue was charged
against capital; works and rolling stock were allowed to go
unrepaired, or insufficient additions made to them, by which
means the current expenses were rendered delusively small;
long-credit agreements with contractors permitted sundry
disbursements that had virtually been made, to be kept out
of the accounts; and thus the net returns were made to
appear greater than they really were. Naturally new
undertakings put before the moneyed world by companies
whose stock and dividends had been
thus artificially raised, <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
were received with proportionate favour. Under the prestige
of their parentage their shares came out at high premiums,
bringing large profits to the projectors. The hint
was soon taken; and it presently became an established
policy, under the auspices of a prosperity either real or
mock, to get up these subsidiary lines—“calves,” as they
were called in the slang of the initiated—and to traffic in
the premiums their shares commanded. Meanwhile had
been developing, a secondary set of influences which also
contributed to foster unwise enterprises; namely, the business
interests of the lawyers, engineers, contractors, and
others directly or indirectly employed in railway construction.
The ways of getting up and carrying new
schemes, could not fail, in the course of years, to become
familiar to all concerned; and there could not fail to grow
up among them a system of concerted tactics for achieving
their common end. Thus, partly from the jealousy of rival
boards, partly from the greediness of shareholders in purchased
lines, partly from the dishonest schemings of directors,
partly from the manœuvres of those whose occupation
it is to carry out the projects legally authorized, partly, and
perhaps mainly, from the delusive appearance of prosperity
maintained by many established companies, there came the
wild speculations of 1844 and 1845. The consequent disasters,
while they pretty well destroyed the last of these
incentives, left the rest much as they were. Though the
painfully-undeceived public have ceased to aid as they once
did, the various private interests that had grown up have
since been working together as before—have developed
their methods of co-operation into still more complex and
subtle forms; and are even now daily thrusting unfortunate
shareholders into losing undertakings.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to analyze the existing state of things,
however, we would have it clearly understood that we do
not suppose those implicated to be <i>on the average</i> morally
lower than the community at large. Men
taken at random <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
from any class, would, in all probability, behave much in
the same way when placed in like positions. There are
unquestionably directors grossly dishonest. Unquestionably
also there are others whose standard of honour is far higher
than that of most persons. And for the remainder, they
are, doubtless, as good as the mass. Of the engineers,
parliamentary agents, lawyers, contractors, and others
concerned, it may be admitted that though custom has
induced laxity of principle, yet they would be harshly
judged were the transactions which may be recorded
against them, used as tests. Those who do not see how in
these involved affairs, bad deeds may be wrought out by
men not correspondingly bad, will readily do so on considering
all the conditions. In the first place, there is the
familiar fact that the corporate conscience is inferior to the
individual conscience—that a body of men will commit as a
joint act, that which each one of them would shrink from,
did he feel personally responsible. And it may be remarked
that not only is the conduct <i>of</i> a corporate body thus
comparatively lax, but also the conduct <i>towards</i> one. There
is ever a more or less distinct perception, that a broad-backed
company scarcely feels what would be ruinous to a
private person; and this perception is in constant operation
on all railway-boards and their <i>employés</i>, as well as on all
contractors, landowners, and others concerned: leading
them to show a want of principle foreign to their general
behaviour. Again, the indirectness and remoteness of the
evils produced, greatly weaken the restraints on wrongdoing.
Men’s actions are proximately caused by mental
representations of the results to be anticipated; and the
decisions come to, largely depend on the vividness with
which these results can be imagined. A consequence, good
or bad, that is immediate and clearly apprehended, influences
conduct far more potently than a consequence
that has to be traced through a long chain of actions or
influences, and, as eventually reached, is not
a particular and <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
readily conceivable one, but a general and vaguely conceivable
one. Hence, in railway affairs, a questionable
share-transaction, an exorbitant charge, a proceeding which
brings great individual advantage without apparently
injuring any one, and which, even if traced to its ultimate
results, can but very circuitously affect unknown persons
living no one knows where, may be brought home to men
who, could the results be embodied before them, would be
shocked at the cruel injustices they had committed—men
who in their private business, where the results <i>can</i> be thus
embodied, are sufficiently equitable. Further, it requires
to be noted that most of these great delinquencies are
ascribable not to the extreme dishonesty of any one man or
group of men, but to the combined self-interest of many
men and groups of men, whose minor delinquencies are
cumulative. Much as a story which, passing from mouth
to mouth, and receiving a slight exaggeration at each
repetition, comes round to the original narrator in a form
scarcely to be recognised; so, by a little improper influence
on the part of landowners, a little favouritism on the part
of members of Parliament, a little intriguing of lawyers,
a little manœuvring by contractors and engineers, a little
self-seeking on the part of directors, a little under-statement
of estimates and over-statement of traffic, a little magnifying
of the evils to be avoided and the benefits to be gained—it
happens that shareholders are betrayed into ruinous undertakings
by grossly untrue representations, without any one
being guilty of more than a small portion of the fraud.
Bearing in mind then, the comparative laxity of the corporate
conscience; the diffusion and remoteness of the evils
which malpractices produce; and the composite origin of
these malpractices; it becomes possible to understand how,
in railway affairs, gigantic dishonesties can be perpetrated
by men who, on the average, are little if at all below the
generality in moral character.</p>

<p>With this preliminary mitigation we proceed
to detail the <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
various illegitimate influences by which these seemingly
insane extensions and this continual squandering of shareholders’
property are brought about.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Conspicuous among these is the self-interest of landowners.
Once the greatest obstacles to railway enterprise,
owners of estates have of late years been among its chief
promoters. Since the Liverpool and Manchester line was
first defeated by landed opposition, and succeeded with its
second bill only by keeping out of sight of all mansions,
and avoiding game preserves—since the time when the
London and Birmingham Company, after seeing their project
thrown out by a committee of peers who ignored the
evidence, had to “conciliate” opponents by raising the
estimate for land from £250,000 to £750,000—since the
time when Parliamentary counsel justified resistance by
the flimsiest excuses, even to reproaching engineers with
having “trodden down the corn of widows” and “destroyed
the strawberry-beds of gardeners”—since then, a marked
change of policy has taken place. Nor was it in human
nature that it should be otherwise. When it became known
that railway-companies commonly paid for “land and
compensation,” sums varying from £4000 to £8000 per
mile; that men were indemnified for supposed injury to
their property, by sums so inordinate that the greater part
has been known to be returned by the heir as conscience-money;
that in one case £120,000 was given for land said
to be worth but £5000—when it was noised abroad that
large bonuses in the shape of preference shares and the
like, were granted to buy off opposition—when it came to
be an established fact that estates are greatly enhanced in
value by the proximity of railways; it is not surprising
that country gentlemen should have become active friends
of schemes to which they were once the bitterest enemies.
On considering the many temptations, we shall see nothing
wonderful in the fact that in 1845
they were zealous <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
provisional committee-men; nor in the fact that their influence
as promoters enabled them to get large sums for their own
acres. If we are told of squires soliciting interviews with
the engineer of a projected railway; prompting him to
take their side of the country; promising support if he
did, and threatening opposition if he did not; dictating
the course to be followed through their domains; and hinting
that a good price would be expected; we are simply
told of the special modes in which certain private interests
show themselves. If we hear of an extensive landowner
using his influence as chairman of a board of directors, to
project a branch running for many miles through his own
estate, and putting his company to the cost of a parliamentary
contest to carry this line; we hear only of that
which was likely to occur under such circumstances. If
we find now before the public, a line proposed by a large
capitalist, serving among other ends to effect desirable
communications with his property, and the estimates for
which line, though considered by the engineering world
insufficient, are alleged by him to be ample; we have but
a marked case of the distorted representations which under
such conditions self-interest is sure to engender. If we
discover of this or that scheme, that it was got up by the
local nobility and gentry—that they employed to make the
survey a third-rate engineer, who was ready in anticipation
of future benefit to do this for his bare expenses—that
principals and agent wearied the directors of an adjacent
trunk-line to take up their project; threatened that if they
did not their great rival would; alarmed them into concession;
asked for a contribution to their expenses; and
would have gained all these points but for shareholders’
resistance—we do but discover the organized tactics which,
in course of time, naturally grow up under such stimuli.
It is not that these facts are particularly remarkable. From
the gross instance of the landowner who asked £8000 for
that which he eventually accepted £80 for,
down to the <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
every-day instances of influence used to get railway accommodation
for the neighbourhood, the acts of the landed
class are simply manifestations of the average character
acting under special conditions. All that it now behoves
us to notice, is, that we have here a large and powerful
body whose interests are ever pressing on railway extension,
irrespective of its intrinsic propriety.</p>

<p>The great change in the attitude of the Legislature towards
railways, from “the extreme of determined rejection
or dilatory acquiescence, to the opposite extreme of unlimited
concession,” was simultaneous with the change above
described. It could not well fail to be so. Supplying, as
the landowning community does, so large a portion of both
Houses of Parliament, it necessarily follows that the play
of private interests seen in the first, repeats itself in the last
under modified forms, and complicated by other influences.
Remembering the extent to which legislators were themselves
implicated in the speculations of the mania, it is
unlikely that they should since have been free from personal
bias. A return proved, that in 1845 there were 157 members
of Parliament whose names were on the registers of new
companies for sums varying from £291,000 downwards. The
supporters of new projects boasted of the numbers of votes
they could command in the House. Members were personally
canvassed, and peers were solicited. It was publicly
complained in the upper chamber, that “it was nearly impossible
to bring together a jury, some members of which
were not interested in the railway they were about to
assess.” Doubtless this state of things was in a great
degree exceptional; and there has since been not only a
diminution of the temptations, but a marked increase of
equitable feeling. Still, it is not to be expected that private
interests should cease to act. It is not to be expected that
a landowner who, out of Parliament, exerts himself to get
a railway for his district, should, when in Parliament, not
employ the power his new position gives him
to the same <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
end. It is not to be expected that the accumulation of
such individual actions should leave the legislative policy
unchanged. Hence the fact, that the influence once used
to throw out railway bills is now used to carry them.
Hence the fact, that railway committees no longer require a
good traffic case to be made out in justification for the
powers asked. Hence the fact, that railway directors
having seats in the House of Commons, are induced to
pledge their companies to carry out extensions. We could
name a member of Parliament who, having bought an estate
fitly situated, offered to an engineer, also in Parliament, the
making of a railway running through it; and having
obtained the Act (in doing which the influence of himself
and his friend was of course useful), pitted three railway
companies against each other for the purchase of it. We
could name another member of Parliament who, having
projected and obtained powers for an extension through
his property, induced the directors of the main line, with
whom he had great influence, to subscribe half the capital
for his extension, to work it for fifty per cent. of the gross
receipts, and to give up all traffic brought by it on to the
main line until he received four per cent. on his capital;
which was tantamount to a four per cent. guarantee. But
it is not only, nor indeed mainly, from directly personal
motives that legislators have of late years unduly fostered
railway enterprises. Indirectly personal motives of various
kinds have been largely operative. The wish to satisfy
constituents has been one. Inhabitants of an unaccommodated
district, are naturally urgent with their rep­re­sen­ta­tives
to help them to a line. Not unfrequently such
rep­re­sen­ta­tives are conscious that their next elections may
perhaps turn upon their successful response to this appeal.
Even when there is no popular pressure there is the pressure
of their leading political supporters—of large landholders
whom it will not do to neglect; of local lawyers, important
as electioneering friends, to whom a
railway always brings <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
business. Thus, without having immediately private ends,
members of Parliament are often almost coerced into
urging forward schemes which, from a national point of
view, or from a shareholder’s point of view, are very unwise
ones. Then there come the still less direct stimuli. Where
neither personal nor political ends are to be gained, there
are still the interests of a relative to be subserved; or, if not
those of a relative, still those of a friend. And where there
is no decided impulse to the contrary, these motives, of
course, have their weight. Moreover, it requires in fairness
to be said, that possessed as most members of Parliament
are, with the belief that all railway-making is nationally
beneficial, there exist in their minds few or no reasons for
resisting the influences brought to bear on them. True,
shareholders may be injured; but that is their own affair.
The public will be better served; constituents will be
satisfied; friends will be pleased; perhaps private ends
gained: and under some or all of these incentives,
affirmative votes are readily given. Thus, from the Legislature
also, there has of late years proceeded a factitious
stimulus to railway extensions.</p>

<p>From Parliament to Parliamentary agents, and the
general body of lawyers concerned in railway enterprise,
is a ready transition. With these, the getting up and
carrying of new lines and branches is a matter of business.
Whoever traces the process of obtaining a railway Act, or
considers the number of legal transactions involved in the
execution of railway works, or notes the large sums that
figure in half-yearly reports under the head of “law
charges;” will at once see how strong are the temptations
which a new project holds out to solicitors, conveyancers,
and counsel. It has been shown that in past years,
parliamentary expenses have varied from £650 to £3000
per mile; of which a large proportion has gone into the
pockets of the profession. In one contest, £57,000 was
spent among six counsel and twenty solicitors.
At a late <span class="xxpn" id="p068">{68}</span>
meeting of one of our companies it was pointed out, that
the sum expended in legal and parliamentary expenses
during nine years, had reached £480,000; or had averaged
£53,500 a-year. With these and scores of like facts
before them, it would be strange did not so acute a body
of men as lawyers use vigorous efforts and sagacious
devices to promote fresh enterprises. Indeed, if we look
back at the proceedings of 1845, we shall suspect, not
only that lawyers are still the active promoters of fresh
enterprises, but often the originators of them. Many have
heard how in those excited times the projects daily
announced were not uncommonly set afloat by local solicitors—how
these looked over maps to see where plausible
lines could be sketched out—how they canvassed the local
gentry to obtain provisional committeemen—how they
agreed with engineers to make trial surveys—how, under
the wild hopes of the day, they found little difficulty in
forming companies—and how most of them managed to
get as far as the Committee on Standing Orders, if no
farther. Remembering all this, and remembering that
those who were successful are not likely to have forgotten
their cunning, but rather to have yearly exercised and
increased it, we may expect to find railway lawyers among
the most influential of the many parties conspiring to urge
railway proprietaries into disastrous undertakings; and
we shall not be deceived. To a great extent they are in
league with engineers. From the proposal to the completion
of a new line, the lawyer and the engineer work
together; and their interests are throughout identical.
While the one makes the survey, the other prepares the
book of reference. The parish plans which the one gets
ready, the other deposits. The notices to owners and
occupiers which the one fills in, the other serves upon
those concerned. And there are frequent consultations
between them as to the dealing with local opposition and
the obtainment of local support. In the
getting up of <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
their case for Parliament, they necessarily act in concert.
While, before committee, the one gets his ten guineas
per day for attending to give evidence, the other makes
profits on all the complicated transactions which carrying
a bill involves. During the execution of the works they
are in constant correspondence; and alike profit by any
expansion of the undertaking. Thus there naturally arises
in each, the perception that in aiding the other he is
aiding himself; and gradually as, in course of years, the
proceedings come to be often repeated, and a perfect
familiarity with railway politics gained, there grows up a
well-organized system of co-operation between them—a
system rendered the more efficient by the wealth and
influence which each has year by year accumulated.</p>

<p>Among the manœuvres employed by railway solicitors
thus established and thus helped, not the least remarkable
is that of getting their own nominees elected as directors.
It is a fact, which we state on good authority, that there
are puppet-directors who vote for this or that at the
instigation of the company’s lawyer. The obtainment of
such tools is not difficult. Vacancies are about to occur in
the directorate. Almost always there are men over whom
a solicitor, conducting the extensive law-business of a
railway, has considerable power: not only connexions and
friends, but persons to whom in his legal capacity he can
do great benefit or great injury. He selects the most
suitable of these; giving the preference, if other things
are equal, to one living in the country near the line. On
opening the matter to him, he points out the sundry
advantages attendant on a director’s position—the free
pass and the many facilities it gives; the annual £100 or
so which the office brings; the honour and influence
accruing; the opportunities for profitable investment that
are likely to occur; and so forth. Should ignorance of
railway affairs be raised as an objection, the tempter, in
whose eyes this ignorance is
a chief recommendation, <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
replies that he shall always be at hand to guide his votes.
Should non-possession of a due amount of the company’s
stock be pleaded, the tempter meets the difficulty by
offering himself to furnish the needful qualification. Thus
incited and flattered, and perhaps conscious that it would
be dangerous to refuse, the intended puppet allows himself
to be put in nomination; and as it is the habit of half-yearly
meetings, unless under great indignation, to elect
any one proposed to them by those in authority, the
nomination is successful. On subsequent occasions this
proceeding can, of course, be repeated; and thus the
company’s legal agent and those leagued with him, may
command sufficient votes to turn the scale in their
own favour.</p>

<p>Then, to the personal interest and power of the head
solicitor, have to be added those of the local solicitors,
with whom he is in daily intercourse. They, too, profit by
new undertakings; they, therefore, are urgent in pressing
them forwards. Acting in co-operation with their chief,
they form a dispersed staff of great influence. They are
active canvassers; they stimulate and concentrate the
feeling of their districts; they encourage rivalry with
other lines; they alarm local shareholders with rumours of
threatened competition. When the question of extension
or non-extension comes to a division, they collect proxies
for the extension party. They bring pressure to bear on
their shareholding clients and relatives. Nay, so deep an
interest do they feel in the decision, as sometimes to create
votes with the view of influencing it. We have before us
the case of a local solicitor, who, before the special
meeting called to adopt or reject a contemplated branch,
transferred portions of his own shares into the names of
sundry members of his family, and so multiplied his seventeen
votes into forty-one; all of which he recorded in
favour of the new scheme.</p>

<p>The morality of railway engineers is
not much above <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
that of railway lawyers. The gossip of Great George
Street is fertile in discreditable revelations. It tells how
So-and-so, like others before him, testified to estimates
which he well knew were insufficient. It makes jocose
allusion to this man as being employed to do his senior’s
“dirty work”—his hard-swearing; and narrates of the
other that, when giving evidence before committee, he was
told by counsel that he was not to be believed even on his
knees. It explains how cheaply the projector of a certain
line executed the parliamentary survey, by employing on it
part of the staff in the pay of another company to which
he was engineer. Now it alludes to the suspicion attaching
to a certain member of the fraternity from his having
let a permanent-way contract, for a term of years, at an
extravagant sum per mile. Again it rumours the great
profits which some of the leaders of the profession made in
1845, by charging for the use of their names at so much
the prospectus: even up to a thousand guineas. And then,
it enlarges on the important advantages possessed by
engineers who have seats in the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Thus lax as is the ethical code of engineers, and greatly
as they are interested in railway enterprise, it is to be
expected that they should be active and not very scrupulous
promoters of it. To illustrate the vigour and skill with
which they further new undertakings, a few facts may be
cited. Not far from London, and lying between two lines
of railway, is an estate lately purchased by one of our
engineers. He has since obtained Acts for branches to
both of the adjacent lines. One of these branches he has
leased to the company whose line it joins; and he has tried
to do the like with the other, but as yet without success.
Even as it is, however, he is considered to have doubled the
value of his property. Again, an engineer of celebrity
once nearly succeeded in smuggling through Parliament,
in the bill for a proposed railway, a clause extending the
limits of deviation, to several miles on each side
of the line, <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
throughout a certain district—the usual limits being but
five chains on each side; and the attempt is accounted for
by the fact, that this engineer possessed mines in this
district. To press forward extensions by the companies with
which they are connected, they occasionally go to great
lengths. Not long since, at a half-yearly meeting, certain
projects which the proprietary had already once rejected,
were again brought forward by two engineers who attended
in their capacity of shareholders. Though known to be
personally interested, one of them moved and the other
seconded, that some new proposals from the promoters of
these schemes be considered without delay by the directors.
The motion was carried; the directors approved the proposals;
and again, the proprietors negatived them. A
third time a like effort was made; a third time a conflict
arose; and within a few days of the special meeting at
which the division was to take place, one of these engineers
circulated among the shareholders a pamphlet denying the
allegations of the dissentient party and making counter-statements
which it was then too late to meet. Nay,
he did more: he employed agents to canvass the shareholders
for proxies in support of the new undertaking; and
was obliged to confess as much when charged with it at
the meeting.</p>

<p>Turn we now to contractors. Railway-enterprise has
given to this class of men a gigantic development; not only
in respect of numbers, but in respect of the vast wealth to
which some of them have acquired. Originally, half a
dozen miles of earthwork, fencing, and bridges, was as much
as any single contractor undertook. Of late years, however
it has become common for one man to engage to construct
an entire railway; and deliver it to the company in a fit
condition for opening. Great capital is required for this.
Great profits are made by it. And the fortunes accumulated
in course of time have been such, that sundry contractors
are named as being each able to make a railway
at his own <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
cost. But they are as insatiable as millionaires in general;
and so long as they continue in business at all, are, in some
sort, forced to provide new undertakings to keep their
plant employed. As may be imagined, enormous stocks of
working appliances are needed: many hundreds of earth-waggons
and of horses; many miles of temporary rails and
sleepers; some dozen locomotive engines, and several fixed
ones; innumerable tools; besides vast stores of timber,
bricks, stone, rails, and other constituents of permanent works,
that have been bought on speculation. To keep the capital
thus invested, and also a large staff of <i>employés</i>, standing
idle, entails loss, partly negative, partly positive. The
great contractor, therefore, is both under a strong stimulus
to get fresh work, and enabled by his wealth to do this.
Hence the not unfrequent inversion of the old arrangement
under which companies and engineers employed contractors,
into an arrangement under which contractors employ
engineers and form companies. Many recent undertakings
have been thus set on foot. The most gigantic project
which private enterprise has yet dared, originated with a
distinguished contracting firm. In some cases this mode
of procedure may, perhaps, be advantageous; but in far
more numerous cases its results are disastrous. Interested
in promoting railway extensions, even in a greater degree
than engineers and lawyers, contractors habitually co-operate
with these, either as agents or as coadjutors. Lines are
fostered into being, which it is known from the beginning,
will not pay. Of late, it has become common for landowners,
merchants, and others personally interested, who,
under the belief that their indirect gains will compensate
for their meagre dividends, have themselves raised part of
the capital for a local railway, but cannot raise the rest—it
has become common for such to make an agreement with a
wealthy contractor to construct the line, taking in part
payment a portion of the shares, amounting to perhaps a
third of the whole, and to charge for his
work according to <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
a schedule of prices to be thereafter settled between himself
and the engineer. By this last clause the contractor
renders himself secure. It would never answer his purpose
to take part payment in shares likely to return some £2 per
cent., unless he compensated himself by unusually high
profits; and this subsequent settlement of prices with one
whose interests, like his own, are wrapped up in the
prosecution of the undertaking, ensures him high profits.
Meanwhile, it is noised abroad that all the capital has been
subscribed and the line contracted for; these facts unduly
raise the public estimate of the scheme; the shares are
quoted at much above their true worth; unwary persons
buy; the contractor from time to time parts with his
moiety at fair prices; and the new shareholders ultimately
find themselves part owners of a railway which, unprofitable
as it originally promised to be, had been made yet more
unprofitable by expensiveness of construction. Nor are
these the only cases in which contractors gain after this
fashion. They do the like with lines of their own projecting.
To obtain Acts for these, they sign the sub­scrip­tion-con­tracts
for large amounts; knowing that in the way
above described, they can always make it answer to do
this. So general had the practice latterly become, as to
attract the attention of committees. As was remarked by
a personage noted for his complicity in these transactions—“Committees
are getting too knowing; they won’t stand
that dodge now.” Nevertheless, the thing is still done
under a disguised form. Though contractors no longer
enter their own names on subscription lists for thousands
of shares; yet they effect the same end by making nominal
holders of their foremen and others: themselves being the
real ones.</p>

<p>Of directorial misdoings some samples have already been
given; and more might be added. Besides those arising
from directly personal aims, there are sundry others. One
of these is the increasing
community between railway <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
boards and the House of Commons. There are eighty-one
directors sitting in Parliament; and though some of these
take little part in the affairs of their respective railways, many
of them are the most active members of the boards to
which they belong. We have but to look back a few years,
and mark the unanimity with which companies adopted the
policy of getting themselves represented in the Legislature,
to see that the furtherance of their respective interests—especially
in cases of competition—was the incentive. How
well this policy is understood by the initiated, may be
judged from the fact, that gentlemen are now in some cases
elected on boards, simply because they are members of
Parliament. Of course this implies that railway legislation
is affected by a complicated play of private influences; and
that these influences generally work towards the facilitation
of new enterprises, is obvious. It naturally happens that
directors having seats in the House of Commons can more
or less smooth the way of their annual batch of new bills
through committees. It naturally happens that those
whose companies are not opposed, exchange good offices.
Not only do they aid the passing of schemes in which they
are interested, but they are solicited to undertake further
schemes by those around them. It is a common-sense
conclusion that rep­re­sen­ta­tives of small towns and country
districts needing railway accommodation, who are daily
thrown in contact with the chairman of a company capable
of giving this accommodation, do not neglect the opportunity
of furthering their ends. It is a common-sense
conclusion that by hospitalities, by favours, by flattery, by
the many means used to bias men, they seek to obtain his
assistance. And it is an equally common-sense conclusion
that in many cases they succeed—that by some complication
of persuasions and temptations they swerve him from his
calmer judgment; and so introduce into the company he
represents, influences at variance with its welfare.</p>

<p>Under some motives however—whether
those of direct <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
self-interest, of private favour, or of antagonistic feeling,
matters not here—it is certain that directors are constantly
committing their constituents to unwise enterprises; and
that they frequently employ unjustifiable means for either
eluding or overcoming their opposition. Shareholders
occasionally find that their directors have given to Parliament,
pledges of extension much exceeding any they were
authorised to give; and they are then persuaded that they
are bound to endorse the promises made for them by
their agents. In some cases, among the misleading statements
laid before shareholders to obtain their consent to
a new project, will be found an abstract of the earnings
of a previously-executed branch to which the proposed
one bears some analogy. These earnings are shown (not
always without “cooking”) to be tolerably good and improving;
and it is argued that the new project, having like
prospects, offers a fair investment. Meanwhile, it is not
stated that the capital for this previously-executed branch
was raised on debentures or by guaranteed shares at a
higher rate of interest than the dividend pays; it is not
stated that as the capital for this further undertaking will
be raised on like terms, the annual interest on debt will
swallow up more than the annual revenue; and thus
unsuspecting shareholders—some unacquainted with the
company’s antecedents, some unable to understand its
complicated accounts—give their proxies, or raise their
hands, for new works which will tell with disastrous effect
on their future dividends. In pursuit of their ends,
directors will from time to time go directly in the teeth of
established regulations. Where it has been made a rule
that proxies shall be issued only by order of a meeting of
the proprietors, they will yet issue them without any such
order, when by so doing they can steal a march on dissentients.
If it suits their purpose, they will occasionally
bring forward most important measures without due notice.
In stating the amount of the company’s
stock which has <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
voted with them on a division, they have been known to
include thousands of shares on which a small sum only was
paid up, counting them as though fully paid up.</p>

<p>To complete the sketch, something must be said on the
management of board meetings and meetings of shareholders.
For the first—their decisions are affected by
various manœuvres. Of course, on fit occasions, there is a
whipping-up of those favourable to any project which it is
desired to carry. Were this all, there would be little to
complain of; but something more than this is done. There
are boards in which it is the practice to defeat opposition
by stratagem. The extension party having summoned their
forces for the occasion, and having entered on the minutes
of business a notice worded with the requisite vagueness,
shape their proceedings according to the character of the
meeting. Should their antagonists muster more strongly
than was expected, this vaguely-worded notice serves
simply to introduce some general statement or further
information concerning the project named in it; and the
matter is passed over as though nothing more had been
meant. On the contrary, should the proportion of the
two sides be more favourable, the notice becomes the
basis of a definite motion committing the board to some
important act. If due precautions have been taken, the
motion is passed; and once passed, those who, if present,
would have resisted it, have no remedy; for in railway
government there is no “second reading,” much less a
third. So determined and so unscrupulous are the efforts
sometimes made by the stronger party to overcome and
silence their antagonists, that when a contested measure,
carried by them at the board, has to go before a general
meeting for confirmation, they have been known to pass a
resolution that their dissentient colleagues shall not address
the proprietary!</p>

<p>That, at half-yearly and special meetings, shareholders
should be so readily misled by boards,
even after repeated <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
experience of their un­trust­worth­i­ness, seems at first sight
difficult to understand. The mystery disappears, however,
on inquiry. Very frequently, contested measures are
carried against the sense of the meetings before which they
are laid, by means of the proxies previously collected by
the directors. These proxies are obtained from proprietors
scattered everywhere throughout the kingdom, who are
mostly weak enough to sign the first document sent to
them. Then, of those present when the question is brought
to an issue, not many dare attempt a speech. Of those
who dare, but few are clear-headed enough to see the full
bearings of the measure they are about to vote upon; and
such as can see them are often prevented by nervousness
from doing justice to the views they hold. Moreover,
it must be borne in mind that proprietors displaying
antagonism to the board are usually regarded by their
brother proprietors with more or less reprobation. Unless
the misconduct of the governing body has been very glaring
and very recent, there ever arises in the mass a prejudice
against all playing the part of an opposition. They are
condemned as noisy, and factious, and obstructive; and
often only by determined courage avoid being put down.
Besides these negative reasons for the general inefficiency
of shareholders’ resistance, there are sundry positive ones.
As writes to us a Member of Parliament who has been an
extensive holder of stock in many companies from the
first days of railway enterprise:—“My large and long
acquaintance with Railway Companies’ affairs, enables me
to say, that a large majority of shareholders trust wholly
to their directors, having little or no information, nor
caring to have any opinion of their own. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some others,
better informed but timid, are afraid, by opposing the
directors, of causing a depreciation of the value of their
stock in the market, and are more alarmed at the prospect
of this temporary depreciation than at the permanent loss
entailed on the company by the
useless, and therefore <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
unprofitable, outlay of additional capital. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Others
again, believing that the impending permanent evil is
inevitable, resolve on the spot to sell out immediately, and
to keep up the prices of their shares, also give their support
to the directors.” Thus, from lack of organization and
efficiency among those who express their opposition, and
from the timidity and double-facedness of those who do
not, it happens that extremely unwise projects are carried
by large majorities. Nor is this all. The tactics of the
aggressive party are commonly as skilful as those of their
antagonists are bungling. The chairman, who is generally
the chief promoter of the contested scheme, has it in his
power to favour those who take his own side, and to throw
difficulties in the way of opponents; and this he not unfrequently
does to a great extent—refusing to hear, putting
down on some plea of breach of order, browbeating, even
using threats.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn5" id="fnanch5">5</a>
It generally turns out too, that, whether
intentionally or not, some of the most important motions
are postponed until nearly the close of the meeting, when the
greater part of the shareholders are gone. Large money-votes,
extensive powers, unlimited permits to directors to
take, in certain matters, “such steps as in their judgment
they may deem most expedient,”—these, and the like, are
hurried over during the last half-hour, when the tired and
impatient remnant will no longer listen to objectors; and
when those who have personal ends to serve by outstaying
the rest, carry everything their own way. Indeed, in some
cases, the arrangements are such as almost ensure the
meeting becoming a pro-extension one
towards the end. <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
This result is brought about thus:—A certain portion of
the general body of proprietors are also proprietors of some
subordinate work—some branch line, or canal, or steamboats,
which the Company has purchased or leased; and
as holders of guaranteed stock, ready to take up further
such stock if they can get it, these lean towards projects
that are to be executed on the preference-share system.
They hold their meeting for the declaration of dividend,
&amp;c., as soon as the meeting of the Company at large has
been dissolved; and in the same room. Hence it happens
that being kept together by the prospect of subsequent
business, they gradually, towards the close of the general
meeting, come to form the majority of those present; and
the few ordinary shareholders who have been patient
enough to stay, are outvoted by those having interests
distinct from their own and quite at variance with the
welfare of the Company.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch5" id="fn5">5</a>
We may remark in passing, that the practice of making the chairman
of the board also chairman of the half-yearly meetings, is a very injudicious
one. The directors are the servants of the proprietary; and meet them
from time to time to render an account of their stewardship. That the chief
of these servants, whose proceedings are about to be examined, should
himself act as chief of the jury is absurd. Obviously, the business of each
meeting should be conducted by some one independently chosen for the
purpose; as the Speaker is chosen by the
House of Commons.</p></div>

<p>And here this allusion to the preference-share system,
introduces us to a fact which may fitly close this detail of
private interests and questionable practices—a fact serving
at once to illustrate the subtlety and concert of railway
officialism, and the power it can exert. That this fact may
be fully appreciated, it must be premised, that though
preference-shares do not usually carry votes, they are
sometimes specially endowed with them; and further, that
they occasionally remain unpaid up until the expiration of
a time after which no further calls can be legally made.
In the case in question, a large number of £50 preference-shares
had thus long stood with but £5 paid. Promoters
of extensions, &amp;c., had here a fine opportunity of getting
great power in the Company at small cost; and, as we shall
see, they duly availed themselves of it. Already had their
party twice tried to thrust the proprietors into a new
undertaking of great magnitude. Twice had they entailed
on them an expensive and harassing contest. A third time,
notwithstanding a professed relinquishment
of it, they <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
brought forward substantially the same scheme, and were
defeated only by a small majority. The following extracts
from the division lists we take from the statement of one of
the scrutineers.</p>

<p>To this list, some seven or eight of the Company’s
tradesmen, similarly armed, might be added; raising the
number of the almost factitious shares held by functionaries
to about 5200, and increasing the votes commanded
by them, from its present total of 1068 to upwards of 1100.
If now we separate the £380,000, which these gentlemen
bring to bear against their brother shareholders, into real
and nominal; we find that while not quite £120,000 of it is
<i>bonâ fide</i> property invested, the remaining
£260,000 is nine <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
parts shadow and one part substance. And thus it results,
that by virtue of certain stock actually representing but
£26,000, these lawyers, engineers, counsel, conveyancers,
contractors, bankers, and others interested in the promotion
of new schemes, outweigh more than a quarter of a million
of the real capital held by shareholders whom these
schemes will injure!</p>

<p class="padtopb">Need we any longer wonder, then, at the persistence
of Railway Companies in seemingly reckless competition and ruinous
extensions? Is not this obstinate continuance of a policy that has year
after year proved disastrous, sufficiently explicable on contemplating
the many illegitimate influences at work? Is it not manifest that the
small organized party always out-manœuvres the large unorganized one?
Consider their respective characters and circumstances. Here are the
shareholders diffused throughout the kingdom, in towns and country
houses; knowing nothing of each other, and too remote to co-operate
were they acquainted. Very few of them see a railway journal; and
scarcely any know much of railway politics. Necessarily a fluctuating
body, only a small number are familiar with the Company’s history—its
acts, engagements, policy, management. A great proportion are
incompetent to judge of the matters that come before them, and lack
decision to act out such judgments as they may form—executors who do
not like to take steps involving much responsibility; trustees fearful
of interfering with the property under their care, lest possible
loss should entail a lawsuit; widows who have never in their lives
acted for themselves in any affair of moment; maiden ladies, alike
nervous and innocent of all business knowledge; clergymen whose daily
discipline has been little calculated to make them acute men of the
world; retired tradesmen whose retail transactions have given them
small ability for grasping large considerations; servants possessed
of <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span> accumulated savings and
cramped notions; with sundry others of like helpless characters—all
of them rendered more or less conservative by ignorance or timidity,
and proportionately inclined to support those in authority. To these
should be added the temporary shareholders, who, having bought stock
on speculation, and knowing that a revolution in the Company is likely
to depress prices for a time, have an interest in supporting the board
irrespective of the goodness of its policy. Turn now to those whose
efforts are directed to railway expansion. Consider the constant
pressure of local populations—of small towns, of rural districts, of
landowners: all of them eager for branch accommodation; all of them
with great and definite advantages in view; few of them conscious of
the loss those advantages may entail on others. Remember the influence
of legislators, prompted, some by their constituents, some by personal
aims, and encouraged by the belief that additional railway facilities
are in every case nationally beneficial; and then infer the extent to
which as stated to Mr. Cardwell’s committee, Parliament has “excited
and urged forward” Companies into rivalry. Note the temptations under
which lawyers are placed—the vast profits accruing to them from every
railway contest, whether ending in success or failure; and then imagine
the range and subtlety of their extension manœuvring. Conceive the
urgency of engineers; to the richer of whom more railway-making means
more wealth; to the mass of whom more railway-making means daily bread.
Estimate the capitalist-power of contractors; whose unemployed plant
brings heavy loss; whose plant when employed brings great gain. Then
recollect that to lawyers, engineers, and contractors the getting up
and executing of new undertakings is a business—a business to which
every energy is directed; in which many years of practice have given
great skill; and to the facilitation of which, all means tolerated
by men of the world are thought justifiable. <span class="xxpn"
id="p084">{84}</span> Finally, consider that the classes interested in
carrying out new schemes, are in constant communication, and have every
facility for combined action. A great part of them live in London, and
most of these have offices at Westminster—in Great George Street, in
Parliament Street, clustering round the Legislature. Not only are they
thus concentrated—not only are they throughout the year in frequent
business intercourse; but during the session they are daily together,
in Palace-Yard Hotels, in the lobbies, in the committee-rooms, in the
House of Commons itself. Is it any wonder then, that the wide-spread,
ill-informed unorganized body of shareholders, standing severally
alone, and each pre-occupied with his private affairs, should be
continually out-generalled by the comparatively small but active,
skilful, combined body opposed to them, whose very occupation is at
stake in gaining the victory?</p>

<p>“But how about the directors?” it will perhaps be
asked. “How can they be parties to these obviously
unwise undertakings? They are themselves shareholders;
they gain by whatever benefits the proprietary at large;
they lose by whatever injures it. And if without their
consent, or rather their agency, no new scheme can be
adopted by the Company, the classes interested in fostering
railway enterprise are powerless to do harm.”</p>

<p>This belief in the identity of directorial and proprietary
interests, is the fatal error commonly made by shareholders.
It is this which, in spite of bitter experiences,
leads them to be so careless and so trustful. “Their
profit is our profit; their loss is our loss; they know more
than we do; therefore let us leave the matter to them.”
Such is the argument which more or less definitely passes
through the shareholding mind—an argument of which the
premises are delusive, and the inference disastrous. Let
us consider it in detail.</p>

<p>Not to dwell on the disclosures that have
in years past <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
been made respecting the share-trafficking of directors,
and the large profits realized by it—disclosures which
alone suffice to disprove the assumed identity between the
interests of board and proprietary—and taking for granted
that little, if any, of this now takes place; let us go on
to notice the still-prevailing influences which render this
apparent community of aims illusive. The immediate
interests which directors have in the prosperity of the
Company, are often much less than is supposed. Occasionally
they possess only the bare qualification of £1000
worth of stock. In some instances even this is partly
nominal. Admitting, however, as we do frankly, that in
the great majority of cases the full qualification, and much
more than the qualification, is held; yet it must be borne
in mind that the indirect advantages which a wealthy
member of a board may gain from the prosecution of a
new undertaking, will often far outweigh the direct injury
it will inflict on him by lowering the value of his shares.
A board usually consists, to a considerable extent, of
gentlemen residing at different points throughout the tract
of country traversed by the railway they control: some of
them landowners; some merchants or manufacturers; some
owners of mines or shipping. Almost always some or all
of them are advantaged by a new branch or feeder.
Those in close proximity to it, gain either by enhanced
value of their lands, or by increased facilities of transit for
their commodities. Those at more remote parts of the
main line, though less directly interested, are still frequently
interested in some degree; for every extension
opens up new markets either for produce or raw materials;
and if it is one effecting a junction with some other
system of railways, the greater mercantile conveniences
afforded to directors thus circumstanced, become important.
Obviously, therefore, the indirect profits accruing to such
from one of these extensions, may more than counterbalance
the direct loss upon
their railway investments; <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
and though there are, doubtless, men too honourable to let
such considerations sway them, yet the generality can
scarcely fail to be affected by temptations so strong.
Then we have to remember the influences brought to bear
upon directors having seats in Parliament. Already
these have been noticed; and we recur to them only for
the purpose of pointing out that the immediate evil of
an increased discount on his £1000 worth of stock, may be
to a director of much less consequence than the favours,
patronage, connexions, which his aid in carrying a new
scheme will bring him. So that here too the supposed
identity of interests between directors and shareholders
does not hold.</p>

<p>Moreover, this disunion of interests is increased by the
system of preference-stock. Were there no other cause in
action, the raising of capital for supplementary undertakings,
by issuing shares bearing a guaranteed interest of 5, 6,
and 7 per cent., would destroy that community of motives
supposed to exist between a railway proprietary and its
executive. Little as the fact is recognized, it is yet readily
demonstrable that by raising one of these mortgages, a
Company is forthwith divided into two classes; the one
consisting of the richer shareholders, inclusive of the
directors, and the other of the poorer shareholders; of
which classes the richer one can protect itself from the
losses which the poorer one has to bear—nay, can even
profit by the losses of the poorer one. This assertion,
startling as it will be to many, we will proceed to prove.</p>

<p>When the capital required for a branch or extension is
raised by means of guaranteed shares, it is the custom to
give each proprietor the option of taking up a number of
such shares proportionate to the number of his original
shares. By availing himself of this offer, he partially
protects himself against any loss which the new undertaking
may entail. Should this, not fulfilling the promises
of its advocates, diminish in some
degree the general <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
dividend; yet, a high dividend on the due proportion of
preference-stock, may nearly or quite compensate for this.
Hence, it becomes the policy of all who can do so, to take
up as many guaranteed shares as they can get. But what
happens when the circular announcing this apportionment
of guaranteed shares is sent round? Those who possess
much stock, being generally capitalists, accept as many as
are allotted to them. On the other hand, the smaller
holders, constituting as they do the bulk of the Company,
having no available funds with which to pay the calls on
new shares, are obliged to part with their letters of allotment.
What results? When this additional line has been
opened, and it turns out, as usual, that its revenue is
insufficient to meet the guaranteed dividend on its shares—when
the general income of the Company is laid under
contribution to make up this guaranteed dividend—when
as a consequence, the dividend on the original stock is
diminished; then the poorer shareholders who possess
original stock only, find themselves losers; while the richer
ones, possessing guaranteed shares in addition, find that
their gain on preference-dividends nearly or quite counterbalances
their loss on general dividends. Indeed, as above
hinted, the case is even worse. For as the large share-proprietor
who has obtained his proportion of guaranteed
stock, is not obliged to retain his original stock—as, if he
doubts the paying character of the new undertaking, he
can always sell such of his shares as will suffer from it;
it is obvious that he may, if he pleases, become the possessor
of preference-shares only; and may so obtain a handsome
return for his money at the expense of the Company at
large and the small shareholders in particular. How far
this policy is pursued we do not pretend to say; though
the table given some pages back suggests extensive pursuit
of it. All which it here concerns us to notice, is, that
directors, being mostly men of large means, and being
therefore able to avail themselves
of this guaranteed <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
stock, are liable to be swayed by motives different from
those of the general proprietary. And that they often are
so swayed there cannot be a doubt. Without assuming
that any of them deliberately intend to benefit at the cost
of their co-proprietors; and believing, as we do, that few
of them duly perceive that the protection they will have, is
a protection not available by the shareholders at large; we
think it is a rational deduction from common experience,
that this prospect of compensation often turns the scale in
the minds of those who are hesitating, and diminishes the
opposition of those who disapprove.</p>

<p>Thus, the belief which leads most railway shareholders
to place implicit faith in their directors, is an erroneous one.
It is not true that there is an identity of interest between
the proprietary and its executive. It is not true that the
board forms an efficient guard against the intrigues of
lawyers, engineers, contractors, and others who profit by
railway-making. Contrariwise, its members are not only
liable to be drawn from their line of duty by various
indirect motives, but by the system of guaranteed shares
they are placed under a positive temptation to betray
their constituents.</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now what is the proximate origin of these corruptions?
and what is the remedy for them? What error
in railway legislation is it that has made possible such
complicated chicaneries? Whence arises this facility with
which interested persons thrust companies into unwise
enterprises? We believe there is a very simple answer to
these questions. It is an answer, however, which will at
first sight seem quite irrelevant; and we doubt not that the
corollary we propose drawing from it, will be forthwith
condemned by so-called practical men. Nevertheless, we
are not without hope of showing, both that the evils laboured
under would be excluded were this corollary recognized,
and that recognition of it is not only
feasible, but would <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
even open the way out of sundry perplexities in which
railway legislation is at present involved.</p>

<p>We conceive, then, that the fundamental vice of our
system, as hitherto carried out, lies in <i>the mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tion
of the proprietary contract</i>—the contract tacitly entered into
between each shareholder and the body of shareholders
with whom he unites; and that the remedy for these evils
which have now become so great, lies simply in the
enforcement of an equitable interpretation of this contract.
In reality the contract is a strictly limited one. In
practice it is treated as altogether unlimited. And the
thing needed is, that it should be clearly defined and
abided by.</p>

<p>Our popular form of government has so habituated us to
seeing public questions decided by the voice of the majority,
and the system is so manifestly equitable in the cases daily
before us, that there has been produced in the general
mind, an unhesitating belief that the majority’s right is
unbounded. Under whatever circumstances men co-operate,
it is held that if difference of opinion arises among them,
justice requires that the will of the greater number shall
be executed rather than that of the smaller number; be
the question at issue what it may. So confirmed is this
conviction, that to most this mere suggestion of a doubt will
cause astonishment. Yet it needs but a brief analysis to
show that the conviction is little better than a political
superstition. Instances may readily be selected which
prove, by <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, that the right of a majority
is a purely conditional right, valid only within specific limits.
Let us take a few. Suppose that at the general meeting
of some philanthropic association, it was resolved that in
addition to relieving distress the association should employ
home-missionaries to preach down popery. Might the subscriptions
of Catholics, who had joined the body with charitable
views, be rightfully used for this end? Suppose that
of the members of a book-club, the
greater number, thinking <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
that under existing circumstances rifle-practice is more
important than reading, should decide to change the purpose
of their union, and to apply the funds in hand for the purchase
of powder, ball, and targets. Would the rest be bound by
this decision? Suppose that under the excitement of news
from Australia, the majority of a Freehold Land Society
should determine, not simply to start in a body for the gold
diggings, but to use their accumulated capital to provide
outfits. Would this appropriation of property be just to the
minority? and must these join the expedition? Scarcely
any one would venture an affirmative answer even to the
first of these questions; much less to the others. And
why? Because everyone must perceive that by joining
with others, no man can equitably be committed to acts
utterly foreign to the purpose for which he joined them.
Each of these supposed minorities would properly reply to
those seeking to coerce them:—“We combined with you
for a defined object; we gave money and time for the
furtherance of that object; on all questions thence arising,
we tacitly agreed to conform to the will of the greater
number; but we did not agree to conform on any other
questions. If you induce us to join you by professing a
certain end, and then undertake some other end of which
we were not apprised, you obtain our support under false
pretences; you exceed the expressed or understood compact
to which we committed ourselves; and we are no longer
bound by your decisions.” Clearly this is the only rational
interpretation of the matter. The general principle underlying
the right government of every incorporated body, is,
that its members contract with each other severally to
submit to the will of the majority <i>in all matters concerning
the fulfilment of the objects for which they are incorporated;
but in no others</i>. To this extent only can the contract hold.
For as it is implied in the very nature of a contract, that
those entering into it must know what they contract to do;
and as those who unite with others for
a specified object, <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
cannot contemplate all the unspecified objects which it is
hypothetically possible for the union to undertake; it
follows that the contract entered into cannot extend to
such unspecified objects. And if there exists no expressed
or understood contract between the union and its members
respecting unspecified objects, then for the majority to
coerce the minority into undertaking them, is nothing less
than gross tyranny.</p>

<p>Now this almost self-evident principle is wholly ignored,
alike in our railway legislation and the proceedings of our
companies. Definite as is the purpose with which the promoters
of a public enterprise combine, many other purposes
not dreamed of at the outset are commonly added to it; and
this, apparently, without any suspicion that such a course
is unwarrantable, unless taken with the <i>unanimous</i> consent
of the proprietors. The unsuspecting shareholder who
signed the subscription contract for a line from Greatborough
to Grandport, did so under the belief that this line
would not only be a public benefit but a good investment.
He was familiar with the country. He had been at some
trouble to estimate the traffic. And, fully believing that he
knew what he was embarking in, he put down his name for
a large amount. The line has been made; a few years of
prosperity have justified his foresight; when, at some fatal
special meeting, a project is put before him for a branch
from Littlehomestead to Stonyfield. The will of the board
and the intrigues of the interested, overbear all opposition;
and in spite of the protests of many who like him see its
impolicy, he presently finds himself involved in an undertaking
which, when he joined the promoters of the original
line, he had not the remotest conception would ever be proposed.
From year to year this proceeding is repeated. His
dividends dwindle and his shares go down; and eventually
the congeries of enterprises to which he is committed, grows
so vast that the first enterprise of the series becomes but
a small fraction of the whole. Yet it is in
virtue of his <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
consent to this first of the series, that all the rest are thrust
upon him. He feels that there is injustice somewhere; but,
believing in the unlimited right of a majority, fails to detect
it. He does not see that when the first of these extensions
was proposed, he should have denied the power of his
brother-shareholders to implicate him in an undertaking not
named in their deed of incorporation. He should have told
its proposers that they were perfectly free to form a separate
Company for the execution of it; but that they could not
rightfully compel dissentients to join in a new undertaking,
any more than they could rightfully have compelled dissentients
to join in the original. Had such a shareholder
united with others for the specified purpose of <i>making
railways</i>, he would have had no ground for protest. But
he united with others for the specified purpose of <i>making a
particular railway</i>. Yet such is the confusion of ideas on
the subject, that there is absolutely no difference recognized
between these cases!</p>

<p>It will doubtless be alleged in defence of all this, that
these secondary enterprises are supplementary to the
original one—are in part undertaken for the furtherance of
it; professedly minister to its prosperity; cannot, therefore,
be regarded as altogether separate enterprises. And it is
true that they have this for their excuse. But if it is a
sufficient excuse for accessories of this kind, it may be
made a sufficient excuse for any accessories whatever.
Already, Companies have carried the practice beyond the
making of branches and extensions. Already, under the
plea of bringing traffic to their lines, they have constructed
docks; bought lines of steam-packets; built vast hotels;
deepened river-channels. Already, they have created small
towns for their workmen; erected churches and schools;
salaried clergymen and teachers. Are these warranted on
the ground of advancing the Companies’ interests? Then
thousands of other undertakings are similarly warranted.
If a view to the development of traffic,
justifies the making <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span>
of a branch to some neighbouring coal-mines; then, should
the coal-mines be inefficiently worked, the same view would
justify the purchase of them—would justify the Company in
becoming coal-miner and coal-seller. If anticipated increase
of goods and passengers is a sufficient reason for carrying
a feeder into an agricultural district; then, it is a sufficient
reason for organizing a system of coaches and waggons to
run in connexion with this feeder; for making the requisite
horse-breeding establishments; for hiring the needful
farms; for buying estates; for becoming agriculturists.
If it be allowable to purchase steamers plying in conjunction
with the railway; it must be allowable to purchase
merchant vessels to trade in conjunction with it; it must
be allowable to set up a yard for building such vessels; it
must be allowable to erect depôts at foreign ports for the
receipt of goods; it must be allowable to employ commission
agents for collecting such goods; it must be allowable
to extend a mercantile organization all over the world.
From making its own engines and carriages, a Company
may readily progress to manufacturing its own iron and
growing its own timber. From giving its <i>employés</i> secular
and religious instruction, and providing houses for them,
it may go on to supply them with food, clothing, medical
attendance, and all the needs of life. Beginning simply as
a corporation to make and work a railway between A and
B; it may become a miner, manufacturer, merchant, shipowner,
canal-proprietor, hotel-keeper, landowner, house-builder,
farmer, retail-trader, priest, teacher—an organization
of indefinite extent and complication. There is no
logical alternative between permitting this, and strictly
limiting the corporation to the object first agreed upon.
A man joining with others for a specific purpose, must be
held to commit himself to that purpose only; or else to all
purposes whatever which they may choose to undertake.</p>

<p>But proprietors dissenting from one of these supplementary
projects are told that they have
the option of <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
selling out. So might the dissentients from a new State-enforced
creed be told, that if they did not like it they might
leave the country. The one reply is little more satisfactory
than the other would be. The opposing shareholder sees
himself in possession of a good investment—one perhaps
which, as an original subscriber, he ran some risk in
obtaining. This investment is about to be endangered by
an act not named in the deed of incorporation. And his
protests are met by saying, that if he fears the danger he
may part with his investment. Surely this choice between
two evils scarcely meets his claims. Moreover, he has not
even this in any fair sense. It is often an unfavourable
time to sell. The very rumour of one of these extensions
frequently causes a depreciation of stock. And if many of
the minority throw their shares on the market, this depreciation
is greatly increased; a fact which further hinders
them from selling. So that each is in a dilemma: he has
to part with a good investment at much less than its value;
or to run the risk of having its value greatly diminished.</p>

<p>The injustice thus inflicted on minorities is, indeed,
already recognized in a vague way. The recently-established
Standing Order of the House of Lords, that before a Company
carry out any new undertaking, three-fourths of the
votes of the proprietors shall be recorded in its favour,
clearly implies a perception that the usual rule of the
majority does not apply. And again, in the case of The
Great Western Railway Company <i>versus</i> Rushout, the
decision that the funds of the Company could not be used
for purposes not originally authorized, without a special
legislative permit, involves the doctrine that the will of the
greater number is not of unlimited validity. In both these
cases, however, it is taken for granted that a State-warrant
can justify an act which without it would be unjustifiable.
We must take leave to question this. If it be held that an
Act of Parliament can make murder proper, or can give
rectitude to robbery; it may be consistently
held that it <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
can sanctify a breach of contract; but not otherwise. We
are not about to enter upon the vexed question of the
standard of right and wrong; and to inquire whether it is
the function of a government to make rules of conduct, or
simply to enforce rules deducible from the laws of social
life. We are content, for the occasion, to adopt the
expediency-hypothesis; and adopting it, must yet contend
that, rightly interpreted, it gives no countenance to this
supposed power of a Government to alter the limits of
an equitable contract against the wishes of some of the
contracting parties. For, as understood by its teachers
and their chief disciples, the doctrine of expediency is
not a doctrine implying that each particular act is to
be determined by the particular consequences that may
be expected to flow from it; but that the general consequences
of entire classes of acts having been ascertained
by induction from experience, rules shall be framed for the
regulation of such classes of acts, and each rule shall be
uniformly applied to every act coming under it. Our whole
ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice proceeds on this principle of
invariably enforcing an ordained course, regardless of
special results. Were immediate consequences to be considered,
the verdict gained by the rich creditor against the
poor debtor would generally be reversed; for the starvation
of the last is a much greater evil than the inconvenience of
the first. Most thefts arising from distress would go
unpunished; a large proportion of men’s wills would be
cancelled; many of the wealthy would be dispossessed of
their fortunes. But it is clearly seen that were judges thus
guided by proximate evils and benefits, the ultimate result
would be social confusion; that what was immediately
expedient would be ultimately inexpedient; and hence the
aim at rigorous uniformity, spite of incidental hardships.
Now, the binding nature of agreements is one of the commonest
and most important principles of civil law. A large
part of the causes daily heard in our
courts, involve the <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span>
question, whether in virtue of some expressed or understood
contract, some of those concerned are, or are not, bound to
certain acts or certain payments. And when it has been
decided what the contract implies, the matter is settled.
The contract itself is held sacred. This sacredness of a
contract being, according to the expediency-hypothesis,
justified by the experience of all nations in all times that it
is generally beneficial, it is <i>not</i> competent for a Legislature
to declare that contracts are violable. Assuming that the
contracts are themselves equitable, there is no rational
system of ethics which warrants the alteration or dissolving
of them, save by the consent of all concerned. If then it
be shown, as we think it has been shown, that the contract
tacitly entered into by railway shareholders with each
other, has definite limits; it is the function of the Government
to <i>enforce</i>, and not to <i>abolish</i>, those limits. It cannot
decline to enforce them without running counter, not
only to all theories of moral obligation, but to its own
judicial system. It cannot abolish them without glaring
self-stultification.</p>

<p>Returning, now, to the manifold evils of which the cause
was asked; it only remains to point out that, were the just
construction of the proprietary contract insisted upon, such
evils would, in great part, be excluded. The various
illicit influences by which Companies are daily betrayed
into disastrous extensions, would necessarily be inoperative
when such extensions could not be undertaken by them.
When such extensions had to be undertaken by independent
bodies of shareholders, with no one to guarantee
them good dividends, those who are locally and professionally
interested would find it a less easy matter than at
present to aggrandize themselves at the expense of others.</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now as to the policy of thus modifying railway
legislation—the commercial policy we mean. Leaving out
of sight the more general social interests, let
us glance at <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
the effects on business interests—the proximate instead of
the ultimate effects. The implication contained in the last
paragraph, that the making of supplementary lines would
no longer be so facile, will be thought to prove the
disadvantage of any such limit as the one advocated.
Many will argue, that to restrict Companies to their
original undertakings would fatally cripple railway enterprise.
Many others will remark, that, however detrimental
to shareholders this extension system may have been, it
has manifestly proved beneficial to the public. Both these
positions seem to us more than questionable. We will first
look at the last of them.</p>

<p>Even were travelling accommodation the sole thing to
be considered, it would not be true that prodigality in new
lines has been advantageous. The districts supplied have,
in many cases, themselves been injured by it. It is shown
by the evidence given before the Select Committee on
Railway and Canal Bills, that in Lancashire, the existence
of competing lines has, in some cases, both diminished the
facilities of communication and increased the cost. It is
further shown by this evidence, that a town obtaining
branches from two antagonist Companies, by-and-by, in
consequence of a working arrangement between these
Companies, comes to be worse off than if it had but one
branch; and Hastings is quoted as an example. It is
again shown that a district may be wholly deprived of
railway accommodation by granting a superfluity of lines;
as in the case of Wilts and Dorset. In 1844–5, the Great
Western and the South Western Companies projected
rival systems of lines, supplying these and parts of the
adjacent counties. The Board of Trade, “asserting that
there was not sufficient traffic to remunerate an outlay for
two independent railways,” reported in favour of the Great
Western schemes; and bills were granted for them: a
certain agreement, suggested by the Board of Trade, being
at the same time made with the South
Western, which, in <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
return for specified advantages, conceded this district to
its rival. Notwithstanding this agreement, the South
Western, in 1847, projected an extension calculated to
take most of the traffic from the Great Western extensions;
and in 1848, Parliament, though it had virtually suggested
this agreement, and though the Great Western Company
had already spent a million and a half in part execution
of the new lines, authorized the South Western project.
The result was, that the Great Western Company suspended
their works; the South Western Company were
unable, from financial difficulties, to proceed with theirs;
the district has remained for years unaccommodated; and
only since the powers granted to the South Western have
expired from delay, has the Great Western recommenced
its long-suspended undertakings.</p>

<p>And if this undue multiplication of supplementary lines
has often directly decreased the facilities of communication,
still more has it done this indirectly, by maintaining the
cost of travelling on the main lines. Little as the public
are conscious of the fact, it is nevertheless true, that they
pay for the accommodation of unremunerative districts,
by high fares in remunerative districts. Before this reckless
branch-making commenced, 8 and 9 per cent. were
the dividends returned by our chief railways; and these
dividends were rapidly increasing. The maximum dividend
allowed by their Acts is 10 per cent. Had there not been
unprofitable extensions, this maximum would have been
reached many years since; and in the absence of the
power to undertake new works, the fact that it had been
reached could not have been hidden. Lower rates for
goods and passengers would necessarily have followed.
These would have caused much additional traffic; and
with the aid of the natural increase otherwise going on,
the maximum would shortly again have been reached.
There can scarcely be a doubt that repetitions of this
process would, before now, have reduced
the fares and <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
freights on our main lines by at least one-third. This
reduction, be it remembered, would have affected those
railways which subserve commercial and social intercourse
in the greatest degree—would, therefore, have applied to
the most important part of the traffic throughout the
kingdom. As it is, however, this greater proportion of
the traffic has been heavily taxed for the benefit of the
smaller proportion. That the tens who travel on branches
might have railway communication, the hundreds who
travel along main lines have been charged 30, or 40 per
cent. extra. Nay, worse: that these few might be accommodated,
the many who would have been brought on to
the main lines by lower fares have gone unaccommodated.
Is it then so clear that undertakings which have been
disastrous to shareholders have yet been beneficial to
the public?</p>

<p>But it is not only in greater cost of transit that the evil
has been felt; it has been felt also in diminished safety.
The multiplication of railway accidents, which has of late
years drawn so much attention, has been in no inconsiderable
degree caused by the extension policy. The relation
is not obvious; and we had ourselves no conception that
such a relation existed, until the facts illustrative of it
were furnished to us by a director who had witnessed the
whole process of causation. When preference-share dividends
and guarantees began to make large draughts upon
half-yearly returns—when original stock was greatly depreciated,
and the dividends upon it fell from 9 and 8 per
cent. to 4&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
and 4 and 3&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#xfeff;,
great dissatisfaction necessarily
arose among shareholders. There were stormy meetings,
motions of censure, and committees of investigation.
Retrenchment was the general cry; and retrenchment
was carried to a most imprudent extent. Directors with
an indignant proprietary to face, and under the fear that
their next dividend would be no greater, perhaps less, than
the last, dared not to lay out money for
the needful repairs. <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
Permanent way, reported to them as requiring to be replaced,
was made to serve awhile longer. Old rolling
stock was not superseded by new to the proper extent;
nor increased in proportion to the demand. Committees,
appointed to examine where the expenditure could be cut
down, went round discharging a porter here, dispensing
with a clerk there, and diminishing the salaries of the
officials in general. To such a length was this policy
carried, that in one case, to effect a saving of £1200
per annum, the working staff was so crippled as to cause,
in the course of a few years, a loss of probably £100,000:
such, at least, is the opinion of the gentleman on whose
authority we make this statement, who was himself one
of the retrenchment committee. What, now, was the
necessary result of all this? With the line out of condition;
with engines and carriages neither sufficient in number
nor in the best working order; with drivers, guards,
porters, clerks, and the rest, decreased to the smallest
number with which it was possible to work; with inexperienced
managers in place of the experienced ones
driven away by reduced salaries; what was likely to occur?
Was it not certain that an apparatus of means just
competent to deal with the ordinary traffic, would be
incompetent to deal with extraordinary traffic? that a
decimated body of officials under inferior regulation, would
fail in the emergencies sure from time to time to occur?
that with way and works and rolling stock all below par,
there would occasionally be a concurrence of small defects,
permitting something to go wrong? Was not a multiplication
of accidents inevitable? No one can doubt it.
And if we trace back this result step by step to its original
cause—the reckless expenditure on new lines—we shall
see further reason to doubt whether such expenditure
has been as advantageous to the public as is supposed.
We shall hesitate to indorse the opinion of the Select
Committee on Railway and Canal Bills,
that it is <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
desirable “to increase the facility for obtaining lines of
local convenience.”</p>

<p>Still more doubtful becomes the alleged benefit accruing
to the public from extensions which cause loss to shareholders,
when, from considering the question as one of
traffic, we turn to consider it as a general commercial
question—a question of political economy. Were there no
facts showing that the travelling facilities gained were
counterbalanced, if not more than counterbalanced, by
the travelling facilities lost; we should still contend that
the making of branches which do not return fair dividends,
is a national evil, and not a national good. The prevalent
error committed in studying matters of this nature, consists
in looking at them separately, rather than in connexion
with other social wants and social benefits. Not only
does one of these undertakings, when executed, affect
society in various ways, but the effort put forth in the
execution of it affects society in various ways; and to
form a true estimate, the two sets of results must be
compared. The axiom that “action and re-action are equal,
and in opposite directions,” is true, not only in mechanics—it
is true everywhere. No power can be put forth by a
nation to achieve a given end, without producing, for the
time being, a corresponding inability to achieve some other
end. No amount of capital can be abstracted for one
purpose, without involving an equivalent lack of capital
for another purpose. Every advantage wrought out by
labour, is purchased by the relinquishment of some alternative
advantage which that labour might else have
wrought out. In judging, therefore, of the benefits
flowing from any public undertaking, it is requisite to
consider them not by themselves, but as compared with
the benefits which the invested capital would otherwise
have secured. But how can these relative benefits be
measured? it may be asked. Very simply. The rate of
interest which the capital will bring
as thus respectively <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
employed, is the measure. Money which, if used for a
certain end, gives a smaller return than it would give if
otherwise used, is used dis­ad­van­tag­eous­ly, not only to
its possessors, but to the com­munity. This is a corollary
from the commonest principles of political economy—a
corollary so obvious that we can scarcely understand how,
after the free-trade controversy, a committee, numbering
among its members Mr. Bright and Mr. Cardwell, should
have overlooked it. Have we not been long ago taught,
that in the mercantile world capital goes where it is most
wanted—that the business which is at any time attracting
capital by unusually high returns, is a business proved
by that very fact to be unusually active—that its unusual
activity shows society to be making great demands upon
it; giving it high profits; wanting its commodities or
services more than other commodities or services? Do
not comparisons among our railways demonstrate that
those paying large dividends are those subserving the
public needs in a greater degree than those paying small
dividends? and is it not obvious that the efforts of
capitalists to get these large dividends led them to supply
the greater needs before the lesser needs? Surely, the
same law which holds in ordinary commerce, and also
holds between one railway investment and another, holds
likewise between railway investments and other investments.
If the money spent in making branches and
feeders is yielding an average return of from 1 to 2 per
cent.; while if employed in land-draining or ship-building,
it would return 4 or 5 per cent.; it is a conclusive
proof that money is more wanted for land-draining and
ship-building than for branch-making. And the general
conclusions to be drawn are, that that large proportion of
railway capital which does not pay the current rate of
interest, is capital ill laid out; that if the returns on such
proportion were capitalized at the current rate of interest,
the resulting sum would represent its real
value; and that <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span>
the difference between this sum and the amount expended,
would indicate the national loss—a loss which, on the lowest
estimate, would exceed £100,000,000. And however true
it may be that the sum invested in unprofitable lines will go
on increasing in productiveness; yet as, if more wisely
invested, it would similarly have gone on increasing in
productiveness, perhaps even at a greater rate, this vast
loss must be regarded as a permanent and not as a temporary
one.</p>

<p>Again then, we ask, is it so obvious that undertakings
which have been disastrous to shareholders have been
advantageous to the public? Is it not obvious, rather,
that, in this respect, as in others, the interests of
shareholders and the public are in the end identical?
And does it not seem that instead of recommending
“increased facilities for obtaining lines of local convenience,”
the Select Committee might properly have
reported that the existing facilities are abnormally great,
and should be decreased?</p>

<p>There remains still to be considered the other of the two
objections above stated as liable to be raised against the
proposed interpretation of the proprietary contract—the
objection, namely, that it would be a serious hindrance to
railway enterprise. After what has already been said, it is
scarcely needful to reply, that the hindrance would be no
greater than is natural and healthful—no greater than is
requisite to hold in check the private interests at variance
with public ones. This notion that railway enterprise will
not go on with due activity without artificial incentives—that
bills for local extensions “rather need encouragement,”
as the Committee say, is nothing but a remnant of protectionism.
The motive which has hitherto led to the formation
of all independent railway companies—the search of
capitalists for good investments—may safely be left to form
others as fast as local requirements become great enough to
promise fair returns—as fast, that is,
as local requirements <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span>
should be satisfied. This would be manifest enough without
illustration; but there are facts proving it.</p>

<p>Already we have incidentally referred to the circumstance,
that it has of late become common for landowners, merchants,
and others locally interested, to get up railways for their own
accommodation, which they do not expect to pay satisfactory
dividends; and in which they are yet content to invest
considerable sums, under the belief that the indirect profits
accruing to them from increased facilities of traffic, will outbalance
the direct loss. To so great an extent is this policy
being carried that, as stated to the Select Committee, “in
Yorkshire and Northumberland, where branch lines are
being made through mere agricultural districts, the landowners
are <i>giving their land</i> for the purpose, and taking
shares.” With such examples before us, it cannot rationally
be doubted that there will always be capital forthcoming for
making local lines as soon as the sum of the calculated
benefits, direct and indirect, justifies its expenditure.</p>

<p>“But,” it will be urged, “a branch that would be
unremunerative as an independent property, is often remunerative
to the company which has made it, in virtue of the
traffic it brings to the trunk line. Though yielding meagre
returns on its own capital, yet, by increasing the returns on
the capital of the trunk line, it compensates, or more than
compensates. Were the existing company, however, forbidden
to extend its undertaking, such a branch would not
be made; and injury would result.” This is all true, with
the exception of the last assertion, that such a branch
would not be made. Though in its corporate capacity the
company owning the trunk line would be unable to execute
a work of this nature, there would be nothing to prevent
individual shareholders in the trunk line from uniting
to execute it; and were the prospects as favourable as is
assumed, this course, being manifestly advantageous to
individual shareholders, would be pursued by many of
them. If, acting in concert with
others similarly <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
circumstanced, the owner of £10,000 worth of stock in the trunk
line, could aid the carrying out of a proposed feeder
promising to return only 2 per cent. on its cost, by taking
shares to the extent of £1000, it would answer his purpose
to do this, providing the extra traffic it brought would raise
the trunk-line dividend by one-fourth per cent. Thus,
under a limited proprietary contract, companies would still,
as now, foster extensions where they were wanted: the
only difference being that, in the absence of guaranteed
dividends, due caution would be shown; and the poorer
shareholders would not, as at present, be sacrificed to
the richer.</p>

<p>In brief, our position is, that whenever, by the efforts
of all parties to be advantaged—local landowners, manufacturers,
merchants, trunk-line shareholders, &amp;c., the
capital for an extension can be raised—whenever it becomes
clear to all such, that their indirect profits plus their
direct profits will make the investment a paying one;
the fact is proof that the line is wanted. On the contrary,
whenever the prospective gains to those interested are
insufficient to induce them to undertake it, the fact is proof
that the line is not wanted so much as other things are
wanted, and therefore <i>ought not to be made</i>. Instead,
then, of the principle we advocate being objectionable as
a check to railway enterprise, one of its merits is, that
by destroying the artificial incentives to such enterprise,
it would confine it within normal limits.</p>

<p>A perusal of the evidence given before the Select
Committee will show that it has sundry other merits, which
we have space only to indicate.</p>

<p>It is estimated by Mr. Laing—and Mr. Stephenson,
while declining to commit himself to the estimate, “does
not believe he has overstated it,”—that out of the
£280,000,000 already raised for the construction of our
railways, £70,000,000 has been needlessly spent in contests,
in duplicate lines, in “the multiplication of an immense
number of schemes prosecuted at
an almost reckless <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>
expense;” and Mr. Stephenson believes that this sum is
“a very inadequate rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the actual loss in
point of convenience, economy, and other circumstances
connected with traffic, which the public has sustained by
reason of parliamentary carelessness in legislating for railways.”
Under an equitable interpretation of the proprietary
contract, the greater part of this would have been avoided.</p>

<p>The competition between rival companies in extension
and branch-making, which has already done vast injury,
and the effects of which, if not stopped, will, in the opinion
of Mr. Stephenson, be such that “property now paying
5&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
per cent. will in ten years be worth only 3 per cent., and
that on twenty-one millions of money”—this competition
could never have existed in its intense and deleterious
form under the limiting principle we advocate.</p>

<p>Prompted by jealousy and antagonism, our companies
have obtained powers for 2000 miles of railway which
they have never made. The millions thus squandered in
surveys and parliamentary contests—“food for lawyers and
engineers”—would nearly all have been saved, had each
supplementary line been obtainable only by an independent
body of proprietors with no one to shield them from the
penalties of reckless scheming.</p>

<p>It is admitted that the branches and feeders constructed
from competitive motives have not been laid out in the best
directions for the public. To defeat, or retaliate upon,
opponents, having been one of the ends—often the chief
end—in making them, routes have been chosen especially
calculated to effect this end; and the local traffic has in
consequence been ill provided for. Had these branches and
feeders, however, been left to the enterprise of their
respective districts, aided by such other enterprise as they
could attract, the reverse would have been the fact; seeing
that on the average, in these smaller cases as in the greater
ones, the routes which most accommodate the public must
be the routes most profitable to projectors.</p>

<p>Were the illegitimate
competition in extension-making <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
done away, there would remain between companies just
that normal competition which is advantageous to all. It
is not true, as is alleged, that there cannot exist between
railways a competition analogous to that which exists
between traders. The evidence of Mr. Saunders, the
secretary of the Great Western Company, proves the
contrary. He shows that where the Great Western and the
North Western railways communicate with the same towns,
as at Birmingham and Oxford, each has tacitly adopted the
fare which the other was charging; and that while there is
thus no competition in fares, there is competition in speed
and accommodation. The results are, that each takes that
portion of the traffic which, in virtue of its position and
local circumstances, naturally falls to its share; that each
stimulates the other to give the greatest advantages it can
afford; and that each keeps the other in order by threatening
to take away its natural share of the traffic if, by
ill-behaviour or inefficiency, it counterbalances the special
advantages it offers. Now, this is just the form which
competition eventually assumes between traders. After it
has been ascertained by underselling what is the lowest
remunerative price at which any commodity can be sold,
the general results are, that that becomes the established
price; that each trader is content to supply those only who,
from proximity or other causes, naturally come to him; and
that only when he treats his customers ill, need he fear that
they will inconvenience themselves by going elsewhere for
their goods.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Is there not, then, pressing need for an amendment of
the laws affecting the proprietary contract—an amendment
which shall transform it from an unlimited into a limited
contract; or rather—not <i>transform</i> it into such, but <i>recognize</i>
it as such? If there be truth in our argument, the absence
of any limitation has been the chief cause of the manifold
evils of our railway
ad­min­i­stra­tion. The share-trafficking <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
of directors; the complicated intrigues of lawyers, engineers,
contractors, and others; the betrayal of proprietaries—all
the complicated corruptions which we have detailed, have
primarily arisen from it, have been made possible by it.
It has rendered travelling more costly and less safe than it
would have been; and while apparently facilitating traffic,
has indirectly hindered it. By fostering antagonism, it has
led to the ill laying-out of supplementary lines; to the
wasting of enormous sums in useless parliamentary contests;
to the loss of an almost incredible amount of national
capital in the making of railways for which there is no due
requirement. Regarded in the mass, the investments of
shareholders have been reduced by it to less than half the
average productiveness which such investments should
possess; and, as all authorities admit, railway property is,
even now, kept below its real value, by the fear of future
depreciations consequent on future extensions. Considering,
then, the vastness of the interests at stake—considering
that the total capital of our companies will soon reach
£300,000,000—considering, on the one hand, the immense
number of persons owning this capital (many of them with
no incomes but what are derived from it), and, on the other
hand, the great extent to which the community is concerned,
both directly as to its commercial facilities, and indirectly
as to the economy of its resources—considering all this, it
becomes extremely important that railway property should
be placed on a secure footing, and railway enterprise
confined within normal bounds. The change is demanded
alike for the welfare of shareholders and the public. No
charge of over-legislation can be brought against it. It is
simply an extension to joint-stock contracts, of the principle
applied to all other contracts; it is merely a fulfilment of
the State’s judicial function in cases hitherto neglected; it
is nothing but a better ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice.</p>

<p class="padtopb"><span class="smcap">P<b>OSTSCRIPT</b>.</span>—That
the proprietary
contract should be <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
strictly ad­hered to, and no under­tak­ings be­yond those
specified in the deed of in­cor­por­a­tion entered upon, is a
doctrine unpalatable to those in authority. A friend who,
as chairman of one of our great railway-companies, has
been familiar with railway-politics and parliamentary
usages in connexion with them, contends that such a
restrictive interpretation would be unworkable; and,
further, that the legislature would never allow itself to be
shackled in the implied way.</p>

<p>That he is right in the last of these assertions I think
highly probable. In face of the currently accepted dogma
that an Act of Parliament can do anything, it is foolish to
expect that Parliament would, by ethical considerations,
be restrained from breaking contracts and authorizing
the breaking of contracts. When we see this dogma
habitually acted upon to the extent of trampling under
foot State-guarantees (as in the case of those who purchased
land under the Irish Encumbered Estates Act, or
as in the case of agreements originally entered into with
companies to confer on them certain powers under certain
conditions) it would be absurd to suppose that any tender
regard for the claims of dissentient proprietors would deter
the ruling body from cancelling the understanding under
which shareholders consented to co-operate. Men must
be much more conscientious than they are before any such
check is likely to be effective.</p>

<p>To the other objection—that such a restriction would
entail an unworkable complication—I entirely demur. That
its consequences would be awkward under our present
form of railway-ad­min­i­stra­tion may be true; but it is also
true that had such a restriction been insisted on, another
and better form of railway-ad­min­i­stra­tion would have
arisen. This will probably be thought an unwarranted
assertion. Nevertheless I make it with some confidence,
since the form of ad­min­i­stra­tion to which I refer is one
which was, in a different guise,
contemplated when railways <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
were originally authorized. To those whose only conception
of the mode of carrying on railway-traffic is that
derived from their daily observations, this will be an
in­comp­re­hen­si­ble statement; but those who remember how
railways were originally intended to be used will know
what I mean.</p>

<p>Novel schemes are always more or less shaped by old
habits. At the time when the first railways were authorized,
the experience men had of coach-travelling on high roads,
affected in various ways the structures of the new appliances
and the natures of the new arrangements. The railway
gauge was determined by the width between the wheels of
a stage-coach. Early first-class carriages were made to
appear like the central parts of three stage-coaches joined
together: preserving their convex panels and curved
outlines, and frequently having, on the centre one, the
words “<i>Tria juncta in uno</i>.” The inside of the first-class
carriage was fitted up to resemble the inside of a stage-coach;
and the original second-class carriage, having
bare wooden seats over which, on vertical iron rods, was
supported a roof allowing the wind and rain to blow
through from side to side, was so designed as to be scarcely
more comfortable than the outside of a coach. For some
years the guard had a seat on the outside, at the end of a
carriage, as on a coach; and for many years the luggage,
covered with tarpaulin, was placed on the roofs of carriages,
as on the outsides of coaches. Once more the booking-offices
were at first like the booking-offices for stage-coaches—places
where passengers entered their names to secure
seats. Little as the fact is now recognized, this kinship of
ideas extended to the contemplated arrangements for
working. Men thought that traffic on railways might be
carried on after the same manner as traffic on high roads.
It was assumed that on lines of rails, where the passing of
vehicles going in the same direction is impracticable, the
system pursued might be like that in use
on high roads, <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
where vehicles can pass and re-pass in any direction and join
or leave the stream at will. Does the reader ask proof of
this? The proof lies in the fact, well-known to those who
were adult in the early days of railways, that in the office
or waiting-room of every railway-station was fixed up a
table of tolls, like that which was fixed up at every toll-gate;
but in this case specifying the rate chargeable per mile for
all things carried—passengers, horses, cattle, goods, &amp;c.
This table of tolls implied that it was within the power
of others besides the company to run vehicles on the
company’s line, and pay them at such and such rates for the
privilege of doing so—a privilege which, so far as I know,
was never made use of, for the sufficient reason that it
would have been impossible to carry on business amid the
confusion which would have resulted.</p>

<p>But while this arrangement, in the form implied, would
have been impracticable, it foreshadows an arrangement
which would have been practicable; and one which would
have grown up had each railway company been limited to
the undertaking specified in its deed of incorporation.
After experience of inefficient co-operation, when so many
independent bodies owning branches and extensions had to
adjust their train services, &amp;c., there would, in all probability,
have been formed what we may call running-companies
or traffic-companies, separate from the original railway-companies.
Each one of these would have proposed to
the companies owning the various main lines, extensions, and
branches, within some large district conveniently delimited,
to undertake the working of their various lines: either
taking them severally on lease, or agreeing to give a
specified share of the net returns annually received, or
agreeing to pay certain tolls for passengers and goods.
Under such an arrangement the original companies, standing
in the position of landlords, would have had for
their chief business to keep the embankments, cuttings,
bridges, permanent way, stations,
&amp;c., in working <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
order; while the running-companies, standing in the
position of tenants, but owning the rolling-stock, would
have had for their business to conduct the passenger and
goods traffic throughout the whole area, with power to
arrange the workings of the various subdivisions of the
system in a harmonious manner. Clearly, if there is an
advantage in division of labour in other cases, there
would have been an advantage in this case. The fixed
works constituting each of these inter-connected railways
would have been kept in more perfect repair, had preservation
of them been the exclusive business of the companies
owning them; while the running-companies, with nothing
to attend to beyond the keeping in order of their rolling-stock
and the management of train-services &amp;c. would
have done this more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>A further reason for believing that better results would
have been achieved than are now achieved, is that under such
circumstances there would have been no absorption of
directors’ time in carrying on railway-wars and getting new
acts of parliament—a business which, under the existing
system, has chiefly occupied the attention of boards.</p>

<p>The enforcement of equitable arrangements is often
fraught with unanticipated benefits; and there seems
reason to think that unanticipated benefits would have
resulted in this case also.</p>

<h2 class="h2nobreak">THE MORALS OF TRADE.</h2></div>

<div class="dchappre">
<p class="pfirst">[<i>First
published in</i> The Westminster Review <i>for April 1859</i>.]</p></div>

<p>We are not about to repeat, under the above title, the often-told
tale of adulterations: albeit, were it our object to deal
with this familiar topic, there are not wanting fresh materials.
It is rather the less-observed and less-known dishonesties of
trade, to which we would here draw attention. The same
lack of con­scien­tious­ness which shows itself in the mixing
of starch with cocoa, in the dilution of butter with lard, in
the colouring of confectionery with chromate of lead and
arsenite of copper, must of course come out in more concealed
forms; and these are nearly, if not quite, as numerous and
as mischievous.</p>

<p>It is not true, as many suppose, that only the lower
classes of the commercial world are guilty of fraudulent
dealing. Those above them are to a great extent blameworthy.
On the average, men who deal in bales and tons differ but
little in morality from men who deal in yards and pounds.
Illicit practices of every form and shade, from venial deception
up to all but direct theft, may be brought home to the
higher grades of our commercial world. Tricks innumerable,
lies acted or uttered, elaborately-devised
frauds, are prevalent: <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
many of them established as “customs of the trade;” nay,
not only established, but defended.</p>

<p>Passing over, then, the much-reprobated shopkeepers, of
whose delinquencies most people know something, let us turn
our attention to the delinquencies of the classes above them
in the mercantile scale.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The business of wholesale houses—in the clothing-trades at
least—is chiefly managed by a class of men called “buyers.”
Each wholesale establishment is usually divided into several
departments; and at the head of each department is placed
one of these functionaries. A buyer is a partially-independent
sub-trader. At the beginning of the year he is
debited with a certain share of the capital of his employers.
With this capital he trades. From the makers he orders for
his department such goods as he thinks will find a market;
and for the goods thus bought he obtains as large a sale as
he can among the retailers of his connexion. The accounts
show at the end of the year what profit has been made on the
capital over which he has command; and, according to the
result, his engagement is continued—perhaps at an increased
salary—or he is discharged.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, bribery would hardly be
expected. Yet we learn, on unquestionable authority, that
buyers habitually bribe and are bribed. Giving presents,
as a means of obtaining custom, is an established practice
between them and all with whom they have dealings.
Their connexions among retailers they extend by treating
and favours; and they are themselves influenced in their
purchases by like means. It might be presumed that self-interest
would in both cases negative this. But apparently,
no very obvious sacrifice results from yielding to such
influences. When, as usually happens, there are many manufacturers
producing articles of like goodness at the same
prices, or many buyers between whose commodities and
whose terms there is little room for choice,
there exists no <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
motive to purchase of one rather than another; and then the
temptation to take some immediate bonus turns the scale.
Whatever be the cause, however, the fact is testified to us
alike in London and the provinces. By manufacturers,
buyers are sumptuously entertained for days together, and
are plied throughout the year with hampers of game, turkeys,
dozens of wine, etc.: nay, they receive actual money-bribes;
sometimes, as we hear from a manufacturer, in the shape of
bank-notes, but more commonly in the shape of discounts on
the amounts of their purchases. The extreme prevalence—universality
we might say—of this system, is proved by the
evidence of one who, disgusted as he is, finds himself inextricably
entangled in it. He confessed to us that all his
transactions were thus tainted. “Each of the buyers with
whom I deal,” he said, “expects an occasional bonus in one
form or other. Some require the bribe to be wrapped up;
and some take it without disguise. To an offer of money,
this one replies—‘Oh, I don’t like that sort of thing,’ but
nevertheless, does not object to money’s-worth; while my
friend So-and-so, who promises to bring me a large trade
this season, will, I very well know, look for one per cent.
discount in cash. The thing is not to be avoided. I could
name sundry buyers who look askance at me, and never
will inspect my goods; and I have no doubt about the
cause—I have not bought their patronage.” And then our
informant appealed to another of the trade, who agreed in
the assertion that in London their business could not be done
on any other terms. So greedy do some of these buyers
become, that their perquisites absorb a great part of the
profits, and make it a question whether it is worth while to
continue the dealing with them. Next, as above hinted,
there comes a like history of transactions between buyers
and retailers—the bribed being now the bribers. One of
those above referred to as habitually expecting douceurs,
said to the giver of them, whose testimony we have just
repeated—“I’ve spent pounds and pounds over ―― <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
(naming a large tailor), and now I think I have gained him
over.” To which confession this buyer added the complaint,
that his house did not make him any allowance for sums
thus disbursed.</p>

<p>Under the buyer, who has absolute control of his own
department in a wholesale house, come sundry assistants,
who transact the business with retail traders; much as retail
trader’s assistants transact the business with the general
public. These higher-class assistants, working under the
same pressure as the lower, are similarly unscrupulous.
Liable to prompt dismissal as they are for failure in selling;
gaining higher positions as they do in proportion to the
quantities of goods they dispose of at profitable rates; and
finding that no objections are made to any dishonest artifices
they use, but rather that they are applauded for them; these
young men display a scarcely credible demoralization. As
we learn from those who have been of them, their duplicity
is unceasing—they speak almost continuous falsehood; and
their tricks range from the simplest to the most Machiavellian.
Take a few samples. When dealing with a retailer, it is an
habitual practice to bear in mind the character of his business;
and to delude him respecting articles of which he has
least experience. If his shop is in a neighbourhood where
the sales are chiefly of inferior goods (a fact ascertained from
the traveller), it is inferred that, having a comparatively
small demand for superior goods, he is a bad judge of them;
and advantage is taken of his ignorance. Again, it is usual
purposely to present samples of cloths, silks, etc., in such
order as to disqualify the perceptions. As, when tasting
different foods or wines, the palate is disabled by something
strongly flavoured, from appreciating the more delicate flavour
of another thing afterwards taken; so with the other organs
of sense, a temporary disability follows an excessive stimulation.
This holds not only with the eyes in judging of colours,
but also, as we are told by one who has been in the trade, it
holds with the fingers in judging of
textures; and cunning <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
salesmen are in the habit of thus partially paralysing the
customers’ perceptions, and then selling second-rate articles
as first-rate ones. Another common manœuvre is that of
raising a false belief of cheapness. Suppose a tailor is laying
in a stock of broad cloths. He is offered a bargain. Three
pieces are put before him—two of good quality, at, perhaps,
14<i>s.</i> per yard; and one of much inferior quality, at 8<i>s.</i> per
yard. These pieces have been purposely a little tumbled
and creased, to give an apparent reason for a pretended
sacrifice upon them. And the tailor is then told that he may
have these nominally-damaged cloths as “a job lot,” at 12<i>s.</i>
per yard. Misled by the appearances into a belief of the
professed sacrifice; impressed, moreover, by the fact that
two of the pieces are really worth considerably more than
the price asked; and not sufficiently bearing in mind that
the great inferiority of the third just balances this; the tailor
probably buys; and he goes away with the comfortable conviction
that he has made a specially-advantageous purchase,
when he has really paid the full price for every yard. A
still more subtle trick has been described to us by one who
himself made use of it, when engaged in one of these wholesale-houses—a
trick so successful that he was often sent for
to sell to customers who could be induced to buy by none
other of the assistants, and who ever afterwards would buy
only of him. His policy was to seem extremely simple and
honest, and, during the first few purchases, to exhibit his
honesty by pointing out defects in the things he was selling;
and then, having gained the customer’s confidence, he
proceeded to pass off upon him inferior goods at superior
prices. These are a few out of the various manœuvres in
constant practice. Of course there is a running accompaniment
of falsehoods, uttered as well as acted. It is expected
of the assistant that he will say whatever is needed to effect
a sale. “Any fool can sell what is wanted,” said a master
in reproaching a shopman for not having persuaded a
customer to buy something quite unlike that
which he asked <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
for. And the unscrupulous mendacity thus required by
employers, and encouraged by example, grows to a height
of depravity that has been described to us in words too
strong to be repeated. Our informant was obliged to
relinquish his position in one of these establishments, because
he could not lower himself to the required depth of degradation.
“You don’t lie as though you believe what you say,”
observed one of his fellow-assistants. And this was uttered
as a reproach!</p>

<p>As those subordinates who have fewest qualms of
conscience are those who succeed the best, are soonest
promoted to more remunerative posts, and have therefore
the greatest chances of establishing businesses of their
own; it may be inferred that the morality of the heads of
these establishments, is much on a par with that of their
<i>employés</i>. The habitual malpractices of wholesale houses,
confirm this inference. Not only, as we have just seen,
are assistants under a pressure impelling them to deceive
purchasers respecting the qualities of the goods they buy,
but purchasers are also deceived in respect to the quantities;
and that, not by an occasional unauthorized trick, but by
an organized system, for which the firm itself is responsible.
The general practice is to make up goods, or to have them
made up, in lengths that are shorter than they profess to
be. A piece of calico nominally thirty-six yards long,
never measures more than thirty-one yards—is understood
throughout the trade to measure only so much. And
the long-accumulating delinquencies which this custom
indicates—the successive diminutions of length, each introduced
by some adept in dishonesty, and then imitated
by his competitors—are now being daily carried to a
still greater extent, wherever they are not likely to be
immediately detected. Articles that are sold in small
bundles, knots, packets, or such forms as negative
measurement at the time of sale, are habitually deficient
in quantity. Silk-laces called six
quarters, or fifty-four <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
inches, really measure four quarters, or thirty-six inches.
Tapes were originally sold in grosses containing twelve
knots of twelve yards each; but these twelve-yard-knots
are now cut of all lengths, from eight yards down to five
yards, and even less—the usual length being six yards.
That is to say, the 144 yards which the gross once contained,
has now in some cases dwindled down to 60 yards.
In widths, as well as in lengths, this deception is practised.
French cotton-braid, for instance (French only in name), is
made of different widths; which are respectively marked
5, 7, 9, 11, etc.: each figure indicating the number of
threads of cotton which the width includes, or rather
should include, but does not. For those which should be
marked 5 are marked 7; and those which should be
marked 7 are marked 9: out of three samples from
different houses shown to us by our informant, only one
contained the alleged number of threads. Fringe, again,
which is sold wrapped on card, will often be found two
inches wide at the end exposed to view, but will diminish
to one inch at the end next the card; or perhaps the first
twenty yards will be good, and all the rest, hidden under
it, will be bad. These frauds are committed unblushingly,
and as a matter of business. We have ourselves read in
an agent’s order-book, the details of an order, specifying
the actual lengths of which the articles were to be cut, and
the much greater lengths to be marked on the labels. And
we have been told by a manufacturer who was required to
make up tapes into lengths of fifteen yards, and label them
“warranted 18 yards,” that when he did not label them
falsely, his goods were sent back to him; and that the
greatest concession he could obtain was to be allowed to
send them without labels.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that in their dealings with
manufacturers, these wholesale-houses adopt a code of
morals differing much from that which regulates their
dealings with retailers. The facts prove it to
be much the <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
same. A buyer for instance (who exclusively conducts the
purchases of a wholesale-house from manufacturers) will
not unfrequently take from a first-class maker, a small
supply of some new fabric, on the pattern of which much
time and money have been spent; and this new-pattern
fabric he will put into the hands of another maker, to have
copied in large quantities. Some buyers, again, give their
orders orally, that they may have the opportunity of
afterwards repudiating them if they wish; and in a case
narrated to us, where a manufacturer who had been thus
deluded, wished on a subsequent occasion to guarantee
himself by obtaining the buyer’s signature to his order, he
was refused it. For other unjust acts of wholesale-houses,
the heads of these establishments are, we presume, responsible.
Small manufacturers working with insufficient
capital, and in times of depression not having the wherewith
to meet their engagements, are often obliged to become
dependants on the wholesale-houses with which they deal;
and are then cruelly taken advantage of. One who has
thus committed himself, has either to sell his accumulated
stock at a great sacrifice—thirty to forty per cent. below
its value—or else to mortgage it; and when the wholesale-house
becomes the mortgagee, the manufacturer has little
chance of escape. He is obliged to work at the wholesale-dealer’s
terms; and ruin almost certainly follows. This is
especially the case in the silk-hosiery business. As was
said to us by one of the larger silk-hosiers, who had
watched the destruction of many of his smaller brethren—“They
may be spared for a time as a cat spares a mouse;
but they are sure to be eaten up in the end.” And we can
the more readily credit this statement from having found
that a like policy is pursued by some provincial curriers in
their dealings with small shoe-makers; and also by hop-merchants
and maltsters in their dealings with small
publicans. We read that in Hindostan the ryots, when
crops fall short, borrow from the Jews to
buy seed; and <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
once in their clutches are doomed. It seems that our
commercial world can furnish parallels.</p>

<p>Of another class of wholesale-traders—those who supply
grocers with foreign and colonial produce—we may say that
though, in consequence of the nature of their business,
their malpractices are less numerous and multiform, as
well as less glaring, they bear the same stamp as the foregoing.
Unless it is to be supposed that sugar and spices
are moral antiseptics as well as physical ones, it must be
expected that wholesale dealers in them will transgress
much as other wholesale dealers do, in those directions
where the facilities are greatest. And the truth is that,
both in the qualities and quantities of the articles they sell,
they take advantage of the retailers. The descriptions
they give of their commodities are habitually mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions.
Samples sent round to their customers are
characterized as first-rate when they are really second-rate.
The travellers are expected to endorse these untrue statements;
and unless the grocer has adequate keenness and
extensive knowledge, he is more or less deceived. In
some cases, indeed, no skill will save him. There are
frauds that have grown up little by little into customs of
the trade, which the retailer must submit to. In the
purchase of sugar, for example, he is imposed on in respect
alike of the goodness and the weight. The history of the
dishonesty is this. Originally the tare allowed by the
merchant on each hogshead, was 14 per cent. of the gross
weight. The actual weight of the wood of which the
hogshead was made, was at that time about 12 per cent. of
the gross weight. And thus the trade-allowance left a
profit of 2 per cent. to the buyer. Gradually, however,
the hogshead has grown thicker and heavier; until now,
instead of amounting to 12 per cent. of the gross weight,
it amounts to 17 per cent. As the allowance of 14 per cent.
still continues, the result is that the retail grocer loses
3 per cent.: to the extent of 3 per cent.
he buys wood <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
in place of sugar. In the quality of the sugar, he is
deluded by the practice of giving him a sample from the
best part of the hogshead. During its voyage from Jamaica
or elsewhere, the contents of a hogshead undergo a slow
drainage. The molasses, of which more or less is always
present, filters from the uppermost part of the mass of
sugar to the lowermost part; and this lowermost part,
technically known as the “foots,” is of darker colour and
smaller value. The quantity of it contained in a hogshead
varies greatly; and the retailer, receiving a false sample,
has to guess what the quantity of “foots” may be; and, to
his cost, often under-estimates it. As will be seen from the
following letter, copied from the <i>Public Ledger</i> for the
20th Oct., 1858, these grievances, more severe even than
we have represented them, are now exciting an agitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>“<i>To the Retail Grocers of the United Kingdom.</i></div>

<div class="pnormal">“Gentlemen,—The time has arrived for the trade at once to make a move
for the revision of tares on all raw sugars. Facts prove the evil of the
present system to be greatly on the increase. We submit a case as under,
and only one out of twenty. On the 30th August, 1858, we bought 3 hogsheads
of Barbados, mark

<p>“We make a claim for £2. 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; we are told by the wholesale grocer
there is no redress.</p>

<p>“There is another evil which the retail grocer has to contend with, that
is, the mode of sampling raw sugars: the foots are excluded from the merchants’
samples. Facts will prove that in thousands of hogsheads of
Barbados this season there is an average of 5 cwt. of foots in each; we have
turned out some with 10 cwt., which are at least 5<i>s.</i> per cwt. less value than
sample, and in these cases we are told again there is no redress.</p>

<p>“These two causes are bringing hundreds of hard-working
men to ruin <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
and will bring hundreds more unless the trade take it up, and we implore
them to unite in obtaining so important a revision.</p>

<p>“Birmingham, October 19, 1858.”</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch6" id="fn6">6</a>
The abuses described in this letter have now, we
believe, been abolished.</p></div>

<p>A more subtle method of imposition remains to be added.
It is the practice of sugar-refiners to put moist, crushed
sugar into dried casks. During the time that elapses before
one of these casks is opened by the retailer, the desiccated
wood has taken up the excess of water from the sugar;
which is thus brought again into good condition. When
the retailer, finding that the cask weighs much more than
was allowed as tare by the wholesale dealer, complains to
him of this excess, the reply is—“Send it up to us, and we
will <i>dry it</i> and weigh it, as is the custom of the trade.”</p>

<p>Without further detailing these malpractices, of which
the above examples are perhaps the worst, we will advert
only to one other point in the transactions of these large
houses—the drawing-up of trade-circulars. It is the habit
of many wholesale dealers to send round to their customers,
periodic accounts of the past transactions, present condition,
and prospects of the markets. Serving as checks on each
other, as they do, these documents are prevented from
swerving very widely from the truth. But it is scarcely to
be expected that they should be quite honest. Those who
issue them, being in most cases interested in the prices of
the commodities referred to in their circulars, are swayed
by their interests in the representations they make respecting
the probabilities of the future. Far-seeing retailers are
on their guard against this. A large provincial grocer,
who thoroughly understands his business, said to us—“As
a rule, I throw trade-circulars on the fire.” And that this
estimate of their trustworthiness is not unwarranted, we
gather from the expressions of those engaged in other
businesses. From two leather-dealers, one in the country
and one in London, we have heard
the same complaint <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
against the circulars published by houses in their trade,
that they are misleading. Not that they state untruths;
but that they produce false impressions by leaving out
facts which they should have stated.</p>

<p class="padtopb">In illustrating the morality of manufacturers, we shall
confine ourselves to one class—those who work in silk. And
it will be the most convenient method of arranging facts,
to follow the silk through its various stages; from its state
when imported, to its state when ready for the wearer.</p>

<p>Bundles of raw silk from abroad—not uncommonly
weighted with rubbish, stones, or rouleaux of Chinese
copper coin, to the loss of the buyer—are disposed of by
auction. Purchases are made on behalf of the silk-dealers
by “sworn brokers;” and the regulation is, that these
sworn brokers shall confine themselves to their functions as
agents. From a silk-manufacturer, however, we learn that
they are currently understood to be themselves speculators
in silk, either directly or by proxy; and that as thus
personally interested in prices, they become faulty as
agents. We give this, however, simply as a prevailing
opinion, for the truth of which we do not vouch.</p>

<p>The silk bought by the London dealer, he sends into the
manufacturing districts to be “thrown;” that is, to be
made into thread fit for weaving. In the established form
of bargain between the silk-dealer and the silk-throwster,
we have a strange instance of an organized and recognized
deception; which has seemingly grown out of a check on a
previous deception. The throwing of silk is necessarily
accompanied by some waste, from broken ends, knots, and
fibres too weak to wind. This waste varies in different
kinds of silk from 3 per cent. to 20 per cent.: the average
being about 5 per cent. The per-centage of waste being
thus variable, it is obvious that in the absence of restraint,
a dishonest silk-throwster might abstract a portion of the
silk; and, on returning the rest to the
dealer, might plead <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
that the great diminution in weight had resulted from the
large amount of loss in the process of throwing. Hence
there has arisen a system, called “working on cost,” which
requires the throwster to send back to the dealer the same
weight of silk which he receives: the meaning of the
phrase being, we presume, that whatever waste the throwster
makes must be at his own cost. Now, as it is impossible
to throw silk without <i>some</i> waste—at least 3 per cent., and
ordinarily 5 per cent.—this arrangement necessitates a
deception; if, indeed, that can be called a deception
which is tacitly understood by all concerned. The silk
has to be weighted. As much as is lost in throwing,
has to be made up by some foreign substance introduced.
Soap is largely used for this. In small quantity, soap is requisite
to facilitate the running of the threads in the process
of manufacture; and the quantity is readily increased.
Sugar also is used. And by one means or other, the threads
are made to absorb enough matter to produce the desired
weight. To this system all silk-throwsters are obliged to
succumb; and some of them carry it to a great extent, as a
means of hiding either carelessness or something worse.</p>

<p>The next stage through which silk passes, is that of
dyeing. Here, too, impositions have grown chronic and
general. In times past, as we learn from a ribbon-manufacturer,
the weighting by water was the chief dishonesty.
Bundles returned from the dyer’s, if not manifestly damp,
still, containing moisture enough to make up for a portion of
the silk that had been kept back; and precautions had to be
taken to escape losses thus entailed. Since then, however,
there has arisen a method of deception which leaves this
far behind—that of employing heavy dyes. The following
details have been given us by a silk-throwster. It is now,
he says, some five-and-thirty years since this method was
commenced. Before that time silk lost a considerable part
of its weight in the copper. The ultimate fibre of silk is
coated, in issuing from the spinneret of
the silk-worm, with <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
a film of varnish which is soluble in boiling water. In
dyeing, therefore, this film, amounting to 25 per cent. of the
entire weight of the silk, is dissolved off; and the silk is
rendered that much lighter. So that originally, for every
sixteen ounces of silk sent to the dyer’s, only twelve ounces
were returned. Gradually, however, by the use of heavy
dyes, this result has been reversed. The silk now gains in
weight; and sometimes to a scarcely credible extent.
According to the requirement, silk is sent back from the
dyer’s of any weight, from twelve ounces to the pound up
to forty ounces to the pound. The original pound of silk,
instead of losing four ounces, as it naturally would, is
actually, when certain black dyes are used, made to gain as
much as twenty-four ounces! Instead of 25 per cent.
lighter, it is returned 150 per cent. heavier—is weighted
with 175 per cent. of foreign matter! Now as, during this
stage of its manufacture, the transactions in silk are carried
on by weight, it is manifest that in the introduction and
development of this system, we have a long history of frauds.
At present all in the trade are aware of it, and on their
guard against it. Like other modes of adulteration, in
becoming established and universal, it has ceased to be profitable
to any one. But it still serves to indicate the morals
of those concerned.</p>

<p>The thrown and dyed silk passes into the hands of the
weaver; and here again we come upon dishonesties.
Manufacturers of figured silks sin against their fellows by
stealing their patterns. The laws which have been found
necessary to prevent this species of piracy, show that it has
been carried to a great extent. Even now it is not prevented.
One who has himself suffered from it, tells us that
manufacturers still get one another’s designs by bribing
the workmen. In their dealings with “buyers,” too, some
manufacturers resort to deceptions: perhaps tempted to do
so by the desire to compensate themselves for the heavy tax
paid in treating, etc. Goods which have
already been seen <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span>
and declined by other buyers, are brought before a subsequent
one with artfully-devised appearances of secrecy,
accompanied by professions that these goods have been
specially reserved for his inspection: a manœuvre by which
an unwary man is sometimes betrayed. That the process of
production has its delusions, scarcely needs saying. In the
ribbon-trade, for example, there is a practice called “top-ending;”
that is, making the first three yards good, and
the rest (which is covered when rolled up) of bad or loose
texture—80 “shutes” to the inch instead of 108. And then
there comes the issuing of imitations made of inferior
materials—textile adulterations as we may call them. This
practice of debasement, not an occasional but an established
one, is carried to a surprising extent, and with surprising
rapidity. Some new fabric, first sold at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per yard, is
supplanted by successive counterfeits; until at the end of
eighteen months a semblance of it is selling at 4<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per
yard. Nay, still greater depreciations of quality and price
take place—from 10<i>s.</i> down to 3<i>s.</i>, and even 2<i>s.</i> per yard.
Until at length the badness of these spurious fabrics
becomes so conspicuous, that they are unsaleable; and
there ensues a reaction, ending either in the reintroduction
of the original fabric, or in the production of some novelty
to supply its place.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Among our notes of malpractices in trade, retail, wholesale,
and manufacturing, we have many others that must be
passed over. We cannot here enlarge on the not uncommon
trick of using false trade-marks; or of imitating another
maker’s wrappers. We must be satisfied with simply
referring to the doings of apparently-reputable houses,
which purchase goods known to be dishonestly obtained.
And we are obliged to refrain from particularizing certain
established arrangements, existing under cover of the
highest respectability, which seem intended to facilitate
these nefarious transactions. The frauds
we have detailed <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
are but samples of a state of things which it would take
a volume to describe in full.</p>

<p>The further instances of trading-immorality which it
seems desirable here to give, are those which carry with
them a certain excuse: showing as they do how insensibly,
and almost irresistibly, men are thrust into vicious practices.
Always, no doubt, some utterly unconscientious trader is
the first to introduce a new form of fraud. He is by-and-by
followed by others who wear their moral codes but loosely.
The more upright traders are continually tempted to adopt
this questionable device which those around them are
adopting. The greater the number who yield, and the more
familiar the device becomes, the more difficult is it for the
remainder to stand out against it. The pressure of competition
upon them becomes more and more severe. They
have to fight an unequal battle: debarred as they are from
one of the sources of profit which their antagonists possess.
And they are finally almost compelled to follow the lead of
the rest. Take for example what has happened in the
candle-trade. As all know, the commoner kinds of candles
are sold in bunches, supposed to weigh a pound each.
Originally, the nominal weight corresponded with the real
weight. But at present the weight is habitually short by
an amount varying from half an ounce to two ounces—is
sometimes depreciated
12&#x202f;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
per cent. If, now, an honest
chandler offers to supply a retailer at, say, six shillings for
the dozen pounds, the answer he receives is—“Oh, we get
them for five-and-eightpence.” “But mine,” replies the
chandler, “are of full weight; while those you buy at five-and-eightpence
are not.” “What does that matter to me?”
the retailer rejoins—“a pound of candles is a pound of
candles: my customers buy them in the bunch, and won’t
know the difference between yours and another’s.” And
the honest chandler, being everywhere met with this argument,
finds that he must either make his bunches of short
weight, or give up business. Take
another case, which, <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
like the last, we have direct from the mouth of one who has
been obliged to succumb. It is that of a manufacturer of
elastic webbing, now extensively used in making boots, etc.
From a London house with which he dealt largely, this
manufacturer recently received a sample of webbing
produced by some one else, accompanied by the question,
“Can you make us this at —— per yard?” (naming a price
below that at which he had before supplied them); and
hinting that if he could not do so they must go elsewhere.
On pulling to pieces the sample (which he showed to us),
this manufacturer found that sundry of the threads which
should have been of silk were of cotton. Indicating this
fact to those who sent him the sample, he replied that, if he
made a like substitution, he could furnish the fabric at the
price named; and the result was that he eventually did
thus furnish it. He saw that if he did not do so, he must
lose a considerable share of his trade. He saw further, that
if he did not at once yield, he would have to yield in the
end; for that other elastic-webbing-makers would one after
another engage to produce this adulterated fabric at
correspondingly diminished prices; and that when at length
he stood alone in selling an apparently-similar article at a
higher price, his business would leave him. This manufacturer
we have the best reasons for knowing to be a man
of fine moral nature, both generous and upright; and yet
we here see him obliged, in a sense, to implicate himself
in one of these processes of vitiation. It is a startling
assertion, but it is none the less a true one, that those
who resist these corruptions often do it at the risk of
bankruptcy; sometimes the certainty of bankruptcy. We
do not say this simply as a manifest inference from the
conditions, as above described. We say it on the warrant
of instances which have been given to us. From one brought
up in his house, we have had the history of a draper who,
carrying his conscience into his shop, refused to commit the
current frauds of the trade. He would
not represent his <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
goods as of better quality than they really were; he would
not say that patterns were just out, when they had been
issued the previous season; he would not warrant to wash
well, colours which he knew to be fugitive. Refraining
from these and the like malpractices of his competitors;
and, as a consequence, daily failing to sell various articles
which his competitors would have sold by force of lying;
his business was so unremunerative that he twice became
bankrupt. And in the opinion of our informant, he inflicted
more evil upon others by his bankruptcies, than he would
have done by committing the usual trade-dishonesties. See,
then, how complicated the question becomes; and how
difficult to estimate the trader’s criminality. Often—generally
indeed—he has to choose between two wrongs.
He has tried to carry on his business with strict integrity.
He has sold none but genuine articles, and has given full
measure. Others in the same business adulterate or otherwise
delude, and are so able to undersell him. His
customers, not adequately appreciating the superiority in
the quality or quantity of his goods, and attracted by the
apparent cheapness at other shops, desert him. Inspection
of his books proves the alarming fact that his diminishing
returns will soon be insufficient to meet his engagements,
and provide for his increasing family. What then must he
do? Must he continue his present course; stop payment;
inflict heavy losses on his creditors; and, with his wife and
children, turn out into the streets? Or must he follow the
example of his competitors; use their artifices; and give
his customers the same apparent advantages? The last not
only seems the least detrimental to himself, but also may be
considered the least detrimental to others. Moreover, the
like is done by men regarded as respectable. Why should
he ruin himself and family in trying to be better than his
neighbours? He will do as they do.</p>

<p>Such is the position of the trader; such is the reasoning
by which he justifies himself; and it is hard
to visit him <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
with harsh condemnation. Of course this statement of the
case is by no means universally true. There are businesses
in which, competition being less active, the excuse for
falling into corrupt practices does not hold; and here,
indeed, we find corrupt practices much less prevalent.
Many traders, too, have obtained connexions which secure
to them adequate returns without descending to small
rogueries; and they have no defence if they thus degrade
themselves. Moreover, there are the men—commonly not
prompted by necessity but by greed—who introduce these
adulterations and petty frauds; and on these should descend
unmitigated indignation: both as being themselves criminals
without excuse, and as causing criminality in others.
Leaving out, however, these comparatively small classes,
most traders by whom the commoner businesses are carried
on, must receive a much more qualified censure than they
at first sight seem to deserve. On all sides we have met
with the same conviction, that for those engaged in the
ordinary trades there are but two courses—either to adopt
the practices of their competitors, or to give up business.
Men in different occupations and in different places—men
naturally conscientious, who manifestly chafed under the
degradations they submitted to, have one and all expressed
to us the sad belief that it is impossible to carry on trade
with strict rectitude. Their concurrent opinion, independently
given by each, is that the scrupulously honest
man must go to the wall.</p>

<p class="padtopb">But that it has been, during the past year, frequently
treated by the daily press, we might here enter at some
length on the topic of banking-delinquencies. As it is, we
may presume all to be familiar with the facts, and shall limit
ourselves to making a few comments.</p>

<p>In the opinion of one whose means of judging have been
second to those of few, the directors of joint-stock-banks
have rarely been guilty of
direct dishonesty. Admitting <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span>
notorious exceptions, the general fact appears to be that
directors have had no immediate interests in furthering
these speculations which have proved so ruinous to depositors
and shareholders; but have usually been among
the greatest sufferers. Their fault has rather been the less
flagitious, though still grave fault, of indifference to their
responsibilities. Often with very inadequate knowledge
they have undertaken to trade with property belonging in
great part to needy people. Instead of using as much care
in the investment of this property as though it were their
own, many of them have shown culpable recklessness:
either themselves loaning the entrusted capital without
adequate guarantee, or else passively allowing their colleagues
to do this. Sundry excuses may doubtless be made
for them. The well-known defects of a corporate conscience,
caused by divided responsibility, must be remembered in
mitigation. And it may also be pleaded for such delinquents
that if shareholders, swayed by reverence for mere
wealth and position, choose as directors, not the most
intelligent, the most experienced, and those of longest-tried
probity, but those of largest capital or highest rank, the
blame must not be cast solely on the men so chosen, but
must be shared by the men who choose them. Nay,
further, it must fall on the public as well as on shareholders;
seeing that this unwise selection of directors is in
part determined by the known bias of depositors. But
after all allowances have been made, it must be admitted
that these bank-administrators who risk the property of
their clients by lending it to speculators, are near akin in
morality to the speculators themselves. As these speculators
risk other men’s money in undertakings which they
hope will be profitable; so do the directors who lend them
the money. If these last plead that the money thus lent
is lent with the belief that it will be repaid with good
interest, the first may similarly plead that they expect their
investment to return the borrowed capital
along with a <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
handsome profit. In each case the transaction is one of
which the evil consequences, if they come, fall more largely
on others than on the actors. And though it may be
contended, on behalf of the director, that what he does is
done chiefly for the benefit of his constituents, whereas the
speculator has in view only his own benefit; it may be
replied that the director’s blameworthiness is not the less
because he took a rash step with a comparatively weak
motive. The truth is that when a bank-director lends the
capital of shareholders to those to whom he would not lend
his own capital, he is guilty of a breach of trust. In
tracing the gradations of crime, we pass from direct robbery
to robbery one, two, three, or more degrees removed.
Though a man who speculates with other people’s money is
not chargeable with direct robbery, he is chargeable with
robbery one degree removed: he deliberately stakes his
neighbour’s property, intending to appropriate the gain, if
any, and to let his neighbour suffer the loss, if any: his
crime is that of contingent robbery. And hence any one
who, standing like a bank-director in the position of
trustee, puts the money with which he is entrusted into
a speculator’s hands, must be called an accessory to contingent
robbery.</p>

<p>If so grave a condemnation is to be passed on those who
lend trust-money to speculators, as well as on the speculators
who borrow it, what shall we say of the still more
delinquent class who obtain loans by fraud—who not only
pawn other men’s property when obtained, but obtain it
under false pretences? For how else than thus must we
describe the doings of those who raise money by accommodation-bills?
When A and B agree, the one to draw and
the other to accept a bill of £1000 for “value received;”
while in truth there has been no sale of goods between
them, or no value received; the transaction is not simply
an embodied lie, but it becomes thereafter a living and
active lie. Whoever discounts the bill, does
so in the <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
belief that B, having become possessed of £1000 worth of
goods, will, when the bill falls due, have either the £1000
worth of goods or some equivalent, with which to meet it.
Did he know that there were no such goods in the hands of
either A or B, and no other property available for liquidating
the bill, he would not discount it—he would not lend
money to a man of straw without security. Had A taken
to the bank a forged mortgage-deed, and obtained a loan
upon it, he would not have committed a greater wrong.
Practically, an accommodation-bill is a forgery. It is an
error to suppose that forgery is limited to the production
of documents that are <i>physically</i> false—that contain signatures
or other symbols which are not what they appear to
be: forgery, properly understood, equally includes the
production of documents that are <i>morally</i> false. What
constitutes the crime committed in forging a bank-note?
Not the mere mechanical imitation. This is but a means
to the end; and, taken alone, is no crime at all. The
crime consists in deluding others into the acceptance of
what seems to be a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of so much money, but
which actually represents nothing. It matters not whether
the delusion is effected by copying the forms of the letters
and figures, as in a forged bank-note, or by copying the
form of expression, as in an accommodation-bill. In either
case a semblance of value is given to that which has no
value; and it is in giving this false appearance of value
that the crime consists. It is true that generally, the
acceptor of an accommodation-bill hopes to be able to meet
it when due. But if those who think this exonerates him,
will remember the many cases in which, by the use of
forged documents, men have obtained possession of moneys
which they hoped presently to replace, and were nevertheless
judged guilty of forgery, they will see that the plea is
insufficient. We contend, then, that the manufacturers of
accommodation-bills should be classed as forgers. That if
the law so classed them, much good would
result, we are <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
not prepared to say. Several questions present themselves:—Whether
such a change would cause inconvenience,
by negativing the many harmless transactions
carried on under this fictitious form by solvent men?
Whether making it penal to use the words “value
received,” unless there <i>had</i> been value received, would not
simply originate an additional class of bills in which these
words were omitted? Whether it would be an advantage
if bills bore on their faces proofs that they did or did not
represent actual sales? Whether a restraint on undue
credit would result, when bankers and discounters saw
that certain bills coming to them in the names of speculative
or unsubstantial traders, were avowed accommodation-bills?
But these are questions we need not go out of our
way to discuss. We are here concerned only with the
morality of the question.</p>

<p>Duly to estimate the greatness of the evils indicated,
however, we must bear in mind both that the fraudulent
transactions thus entered into are numerous, and that each
generally becomes the cause of others. The original lie is
commonly the parent of further lies, which again give rise
to an increasing progeny; and so on for successive generations,
multiplying as they descend. When A and B find
their £1000 bill about to fall due, and the expected proceeds
of their speculation not forthcoming—when they find, as
they often do, either that the investment has resulted in a
loss instead of a gain; or that the time for realizing their
hoped-for profits, has not yet come; or that the profits, if
there are any, do not cover the extravagances of living
which, in the meantime, they have sanguinely indulged in—when,
in short, they find that the bill cannot be taken
up; they resort to the expedient of manufacturing other
bills with which to liquidate the first. And while they are
about it, they usually think it will be as well to raise a somewhat
larger sum than is required to meet their outstanding
engagements. Unless it happens that
great success enables <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
them to redeem themselves, this proceeding is repeated, and
again repeated. So long as there is no monetary crisis, it
continues easy thus to keep afloat; and, indeed, the appearance
of prosperity which is given by an extended circulation
of bills in their names, bearing respectable indorsements,
creates a confidence in them which renders the obtainment
of credit easier than at first. And where, as in some cases,
this process is carried to the extent of employing men in
different towns throughout the kingdom, and even in
distant parts of the world, to accept bills, the appearances
are still better kept up, and the bubble reaches a still
greater development. As, however, all these transactions
are carried on with borrowed capital, on which interest has
to be paid; as, further, the maintenance of this organized
fraud entails constant expenses, as well as occasional
sacrifices; and as it is in the very nature of the system to
generate reckless speculation; the fabric of lies is almost
certain ultimately to fall; and, in falling, to ruin or embarrass
others besides those who had given credit.</p>

<p>Nor does the evil end with the direct penalties from time
to time inflicted on honest traders. There is also a grave
indirect penalty which they suffer from the system. These
forgers of credit are habitually instrumental in lowering
prices below their natural level. To meet emergencies,
they are obliged every now and then to sell goods at a loss:
the alternative being immediate stoppage. Though with
each such concern, this is but an occasional incident, yet,
taking the whole number of them connected with any one
business, it results that there are generally some who are
making sacrifices—generally some who are unnaturally
depressing the market. In short, the capital fraudulently
obtained from some traders is, in part, dissipated in rendering
the business of other traders deficiently remunerative:
often to their serious embarrassment.</p>

<p>If, however, the whole truth must be said, the condemnation
visited on these commercial vampires is
not to be <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
confined to them; but is in some degree deserved by a
much more numerous class. Between the penniless schemer
who obtains the use of capital by false pretences, and the
upright trader who never contracts greater liabilities than
his estate will liquidate, there lie all gradations. From
businesses carried on entirely with other people’s capital,
obtained by forgery, we pass to businesses in which there
is a real capital of one-tenth and a credit-capital of nine-tenths;
to other businesses in which the ratio of real to
fictitious capital is somewhat greater; and so on until we
reach the very extensive class of men who trade but a little
beyond their means. To get more credit than would be
given were the state of the business known, is in all cases
the aim; and the cases in which this credit is partially
unwarranted, differ only in degree from those in which it
is wholly unwarranted. As most are beginning to see, the
prevalence of this indirect dishonesty has not a little to do
with our commercial disasters. Speaking broadly, the
tendency is for every trader to hypothecate the capital of
other traders, as well as his own. And when A has
borrowed on the strength of B’s credit; B on the strength
of C’s; and C on the strength of A’s—when, throughout
the trading world, each has made engagements which he
can meet only by direct or indirect aid—when everybody is
wanting help from some one else to save him from falling; a
crash is certain. The punishment of a general un­con­scien­tious­ness
may be postponed, but it is sure to come eventually.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The average commercial morality cannot, of course, be
accurately depicted in so brief a space. On the one hand,
we have been able to give but a few typical instances of the
malpractices by which trade is disgraced. On the other
hand, we have been obliged to present these alone; unqualified
by the large amount of honest dealing throughout which
they are dispersed. While, by accumulating such evidences,
the indictment may be made heavier;
by diluting them <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
with the immense mass of equitable transactions daily
carried on, the verdict would be mitigated. After making
every allowance, however, we fear that the state of things
is very bad. Our impression on this point is due less to
the particular facts above given, than to the general opinion
expressed by our informants. On all sides we have found
the result of long personal experience, to be the conviction
that trade is essentially corrupt. In tones of disgust or discouragement,
reprehension or derision, according to their
several natures, men in business have one after another
expressed or implied this belief. Omitting the highest mercantile
classes, a few of the less common trades, and those
exceptional cases where an entire command of the market has
been obtained, the uniform testimony of competent judges
is, that success is incompatible with strict integrity. To
live in the commercial world it appears necessary to adopt
its ethical code: neither exceeding nor falling short of it—neither
being less honest nor more honest. Those who sink
below its standard are expelled; while those who rise above
it are either pulled down to it or ruined. As, in self-defence,
the civilized man becomes savage among savages; so, it
seems that in self-defence, the scrupulous trader is obliged
to become as little scrupulous as his competitors. It has
been said that the law of the animal creation is—“Eat and
be eaten;” and of our trading community it may similarly
be said that its law is—Cheat and be cheated. A system
of keen competition, carried on, as it is, without adequate
moral restraint, is very much a system of commercial cannibalism.
Its alternatives are—Use the same weapons as your
antagonists or be conquered and devoured.</p>

<p>Of questions suggested by these facts, one of the most
obvious is—Are not the prejudices which have ever been
entertained against trade and traders, thus fully justified?
do not these meannesses and dishonesties, and the moral
degradation they imply, warrant the disrespect shown to
men in business? A prompt
affirmative answer will <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
probably be looked for; but we very much doubt whether it
should be given. We are rather of opinion that these
delinquencies are products of the average character placed
under special conditions. There is no reason for assuming
that the trading classes are intrinsically worse than other
classes. Men taken at random from higher and lower
ranks, would, most likely, if similarly circumstanced, do
much the same. Indeed the mercantile world might readily
recriminate. Is it a solicitor who comments on their misdoings?
They may quickly silence him by referring to the
countless dark stains on the reputation of his fraternity.
Is it a barrister? His frequent practice of putting in pleas
which he knows are not valid, and his established habit of
taking fees for work he does not perform, make his criticism
somewhat suicidal. Does the condemnation come through
the press? The condemned may remind those who write,
of the fact that it is not quite honest to utter a positive
verdict on a book merely glanced through, or to pen glowing
eulogies on the mediocre work of a friend while slighting
the good one of an enemy; and they may further ask
whether those who, at the dictation of an employer, write
what they disbelieve, are not guilty of the serious offence
of adulterating public opinion. Moreover, traders might
contend that many of their delinquencies are thrust on them
by the injustice of their customers. They, and especially
drapers, might point to the fact that the habitual demand
for an abatement of price, is made in utter disregard of their
reasonable profits; and that, to protect themselves against
attempts to gain by their loss, they are obliged to name
prices greater than those they intend to take. They might
also urge that the straits to which they are often brought
by non-payment of large sums due from their wealthier
customers, is itself a cause of their malpractices: obliging
them, as it does, to use all means, illegitimate as well
as legitimate, for getting the wherewith to meet their
engagements. And then, after proving
that those without <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
excuse show this disregard of other men’s claims, traders
might ask whether they, who have the excuse of having to
contend with a merciless competition, are alone to be blamed
if they display a like disregard in other forms. Nay, even
to the guardians of social rectitude—members of the legislature—they
might use the <i>tu quoque</i> argument: asking
whether bribery of a customer’s servant, is any worse than
bribery of an elector? or whether the gaining of suffrages
by clap-trap hustings-speeches, containing insincere professions
adapted to the taste of the constituency, is not as
bad as getting an order for goods by delusive representations
respecting their quality? No; few if any classes are
free from immoralities which are as great, <i>relatively to
the temptations</i>, as these we have been exposing. Of
course they will not be so petty or so gross where the
circumstances do not prompt pettiness or grossness; nor so
constant and organized where the class-conditions have not
tended to make them habitual. But, taken with these
qualifications, we think that much might be said for the
proposition that the trading classes, neither better nor
worse intrinsically than other classes, are betrayed into
their flagitious habits by external causes.</p>

<p>Another question, here naturally arising, is—Are not
these evils growing worse? Many of the facts we have
cited seem to imply that they are. Yet there are many
other facts which point as distinctly the other way. In
weighing the evidence, we must bear in mind that the
greater public attention at present paid to such matters, is
itself a source of error—is apt to generate the belief that
evils now becoming recognized are evils that have recently
arisen; when in truth they have merely been hitherto disregarded,
or less regarded. It has been clearly thus with
crime, with distress, with popular ignorance; and it is very
probably thus with trading-dishonesties. As it is true of
individual beings, that their height in the scale of creation
may be measured by the degree
of their self-consciousness; <span class="xxpn" id="p141">{141}</span>
so, in a sense, it is true of societies. Advanced and highly-organized
societies are distinguished from lower ones by the
evolution of something that stands for a <i>social self-consciousness</i>.
Among ourselves there has, happily, been of late
years a remarkable growth of this social self-consciousness;
and we believe that to this is chiefly ascribable the impression
that commercial malpractices are increasing. Such
facts as have come down to us respecting the trade of past
times, confirm this view. In his <i>Complete English Tradesman</i>,
Defoe mentions, among other manœuvres of retailers,
the false lights which they introduced into their shops, for
the purpose of giving delusive appearances to their goods.
He comments on the “shop rhetorick,” the “flux of
falsehoods,” which tradesmen habitually uttered to their
customers; and quotes their defence as being that they
could not live without lying. He says, too, that there was
scarce a shopkeeper who had not a bag of spurious or
debased coin, from which he gave change whenever he
could; and that men, even the most honest, triumphed in
their skill in getting rid of bad money. These facts show
that the mercantile morals of that day were, at any rate,
not better than ours; and if we call to mind the numerous
Acts of Parliament passed in old times to prevent frauds of
all kinds, we perceive the like implication. As much may,
indeed, be safely inferred from the general state of society.
When, reign after reign, governments debased the coinage,
the moral tone of the middle classes could scarcely have
been higher than now. Among generations whose sympathy
with the claims of fellow-creatures was so weak, that the
slave-trade was not only thought justifiable, but the initiator
of it was rewarded by permission to record the feat in his
coat of arms, it is hardly possible that men respected the
claims of their fellow-citizens more than at present. Times
characterized by an ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice so inefficient,
that there were in London nests of criminals who defied the
law, and on all high roads robbers who
eluded it, cannot <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
have been distinguished by just mercantile dealings. While,
conversely, an age which, like ours, has seen so many equitable
social changes thrust on the legislature by public
opinion, is very unlikely to be an age in which the transactions
between individuals have been growing more inequitable.
Yet, on the other hand, it is undeniable that many of
the dishonesties we have described are of modern origin.
Not a few of them have become established during the last
thirty years; and others are even now arising. How are
these seeming contradictions to be reconciled?</p>

<p>The reconciliation is not difficult. It lies in the fact that
while the <i>direct</i> frauds have been diminishing, the <i>indirect</i>
frauds have been increasing: alike in variety and in
number. And this admission we take to be consistent with
the opinion that the standard of commercial morals is higher
than it was. For if we omit, as excluded from the question,
the penal restraints—religious and legal—and ask what is
the ultimate moral restraint to the aggression of man on
man, we find it to be—sympathy with the pain inflicted.
Now the keenness of the sympathy, depending on the
vividness with which this pain is realized, varies with the
conditions of the case. It may be active enough to check
misdeeds which will manifestly cause great suffering, and
yet not be active enough to check misdeeds which will
cause but slight annoyance. While sufficiently acute to
prevent a man from doing that which will entail immediate
injury on a known person, it may not be sufficiently acute
to prevent him from doing that which will entail remote
injuries on unknown persons. And we find the facts to
agree with this deduction, that the moral restraint varies
according to the clearness with which the evil consequences
are conceived. Many a one who would shrink from picking
a pocket does not scruple to adulterate his goods; and he
who never dreams of passing base coin will yet be a party
to joint-stock-bank deceptions. Hence, as we say, the
multiplication of the more subtle and
complex forms of <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
fraud, is consistent with a general progress in morality;
provided it is accompanied with a decrease in the grosser
forms of fraud.</p>

<p class="padtopb">But the question which most concerns us is, not whether
the morals of trade are better or worse than they have been?
but rather—why are they so bad? Why in this civilized
state of ours, is there so much that betrays the cunning
selfishness of the savage? Why, after the careful inculcations
of rectitude during education, comes there in after-life
all this knavery? Why, in spite of all the exhortations to
which the commercial classes listen every Sunday, do they
next morning recommence their evil deeds? What is this
so potent agency which almost neutralizes the discipline of
education, of law, of religion?</p>

<p>Various subsidiary causes that might be assigned, must be
passed over, that we may have space to deal with the chief
cause. In an exhaustive statement, something would have
to be said on the credulity of consumers, which leads them
to believe in representations of impossible advantages; and
something, too, on their greediness, which, ever prompting
them to look for more than they ought to get, encourages
sellers to offer delusive bargains. The increased difficulty
of living consequent on growing pressure of population,
might perhaps come in as a part cause; and that greater
cost of bringing up a family, which results from the higher
standard of education, might be added. But the chief
inciter of these trading malpractices is intense desire for
wealth. And if we ask—Why this intense desire? the
reply is—It results from the <i>indiscriminate respect paid
to wealth</i>.</p>

<p>To be distinguished from the common herd—to be somebody—to
make a name, a position—this is the universal
ambition; and to accumulate riches is alike the surest and
the easiest way of fulfilling this ambition. Very early in
life all learn this. At school, the court paid
to one whose <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
parents have called in their carriage to see him, is conspicuous;
while the poor boy whose insufficient stock of
clothes implies the small means of his family, soon has
burnt into his memory the fact that poverty is contemptible.
On entering the world, the lessons which may have been
taught about the nobility of self-sacrifice, the reverence
due to genius, the admirableness of high integrity, are
quickly neutralized by experience: men’s actions proving
that these are not their standards of respect. It is soon
perceived that while abundant outward marks of deference
from fellow-citizens may almost certainly be gained by
directing every energy to the accumulation of property,
they are but rarely to be gained in any other way; and
that even in the few cases in which they are otherwise
gained, they are not given with entire unreserve, but are
commonly joined with a more or less manifest display of
patronage. When, seeing this, the young man further
sees that while the acquisition of property is possible with
his mediocre endowments, the acquirement of distinction
by brilliant discoveries, or heroic acts, or high achievements
in art, implies faculties and feelings which he does not
possess; it is not difficult to understand why he devotes
himself heart and soul to business.</p>

<p>We do not mean to say that men act on the consciously
reasoned-out conclusions thus indicated; but we mean that
these conclusions are the unconsciously-formed products of
their daily experiences. From early childhood the sayings
and doings of all around them have generated the idea that
wealth and respectability are two sides of the same thing.
This idea, growing with their growth, and strengthening
with their strength, becomes at last almost what we may
call an organic conviction. And this organic conviction it
is which prompts the expenditure of all their energies in
money-making. We contend that the chief stimulus is not
the desire for the wealth itself, but for the applause and
position which the wealth brings. And in
this belief, we <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
find ourselves at one with various intelligent traders with
whom we have talked on the matter. It is incredible that
men should make the sacrifices, mental and bodily, which
they do, merely to get the material benefits which money
purchases. Who would undertake an extra burden of
business for the purpose of getting a cellar of choice wines
for his own drinking? He who does it, does it that he
may have choice wines to give his guests and gain their
praises. What merchant would spend an additional hour
at his office daily, merely that he might move into a house
in a more fashionable quarter? He submits to the tax
not to gain health and comfort but for the sake of the
increased social consideration which the new house will
bring him. Where is the man who would lie awake at
nights devising means of increasing his income, in the hope
of being able to provide his wife with a carriage, were the
use of the carriage the sole consideration? It is because
of the <i>éclat</i> which the carriage will give, that he enters on
these additional anxieties. So manifest, so trite, indeed,
are these truths, that we should be ashamed of insisting on
them, did not our argument require it.</p>

<p>For if the desire for that homage which wealth brings, is
the chief stimulus to these strivings after wealth, then the
giving of this homage (when given, as it is, with but little
discrimination) is the chief cause of the dishonesties into
which these strivings betray mercantile men. When the
shopkeeper, on the strength of a prosperous year and
favourable prospects, has yielded to his wife’s persuasions,
and replaced the old furniture with new, at an outlay
greater than his income covers—when, instead of the hoped-for
increase, the next year brings a decrease in his returns—when
he finds that his expenses are out-running his
revenue; then does he fall under the strongest temptation to
adopt some newly-introduced adulteration or other malpractice.
When, having by display gained a certain
recognition, the wholesale trader begins
to give dinners <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
appropriate only to those of ten times his income, with
other expensive entertainments to match—when, having
for a time carried on this style at a cost greater than he
can afford, he finds that he cannot discontinue it without
giving up his position; then is he most strongly prompted
to enter into larger transactions, to trade beyond his means,
to seek undue credit, to get into that ever-complicating
series of misdeeds which ends in disgraceful bankruptcy.
And if these are the facts then is it an unavoidable conclusion
that the blind admiration which society gives to
mere wealth, and the display of wealth, is the chief source
of these multitudinous immoralities.</p>

<p>Yes, the evil is deeper than appears—draws its nutriment
from far below the surface. This gigantic system of dishonesty,
branching out into every conceivable form of
fraud, has roots which run underneath our whole social
fabric, and, sending fibres into every house, suck up
strength from our daily sayings and doings. In every
dining-room a rootlet finds food, when the conversation
turns on So-and-so’s successful speculations, his purchase
of an estate, his probable worth—on this man’s recent large
legacy, and the other’s advantageous match; for being
thus talked about is one form of that tacit respect which
men struggle for. Every drawing-room furnishes nourishment
in the admiration awarded to costliness—to silks that
are “rich,” that is, expensive; to dresses that contain an
enormous quantity of material, that is, are expensive; to
laces that are hand-made, that is, expensive; to diamonds
that are rare, that is, expensive; to china that is old, that
is, expensive. And from scores of small remarks and
minutiæ of behaviour which, in all circles, hourly imply how
completely the idea of respectability involves that of costly
externals, there is drawn fresh pabulum.</p>

<p>We are all implicated. We all, whether with self-approbation
or not, give expression to the established feeling.
Even he who disapproves this feeling finds
himself unable to <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
treat virtue in threadbare apparel with a cordiality as great
as that which he would show to the same virtue endowed
with prosperity. Scarcely a man is to be found who would
not behave with more civility to a knave in broadcloth than
to a knave in fustian. Though for the deference which they
have shown to the vulgar rich, or the dishonestly successful,
men afterwards compound with their consciences by privately
venting their contempt; yet when they again come face to
face with these imposing externals covering worthlessness,
they do as before. And so long as imposing worthlessness
gets the visible marks of respect, while the disrespect felt
for it is hidden, it naturally flourishes.</p>

<p>Hence, then, is it that men persevere in these evil practices
which all condemn. They can so purchase a homage which,
if not genuine, is yet, so far as appearances go, as good as the
best. To one whose wealth has been gained by a life of
frauds, what matters it that his name is in all circles a
synonym of roguery? Has he not been conspicuously
honoured by being twice elected mayor of his town? (we
state a fact) and does not this, joined to the personal consideration
shown him, outweigh in his estimation all that is
said against him; of which he hears scarcely anything?
When, not many years after the exposure of his inequitable
dealing, a trader attains to the highest civic distinction which
the kingdom has to offer, and that, too, through the instrumentality
of those who best know his delinquency, is not the
fact an encouragement to him, and to all others, to sacrifice
rectitude to aggrandizement? If, after listening to a sermon
that has by implication denounced the dishonesties he has
been guilty of, the rich ill-doer finds, on leaving church, that
his neighbours cap to him, does not this tacit approval go
far to neutralize the effect of all he has heard? The truth
is that with the great majority of men, the visible expression
of social opinion is far the most efficient of incentives and
restraints. Let any one who wishes to
estimate the strength <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span>
of this control, propose to himself to walk through the streets
in the dress of a dustman, or hawk vegetables from door to
door. Let him feel, as he probably will, that he had rather
do something morally wrong than commit such a breach of
usage and suffer the resulting derision. He will then
better estimate how powerful a curb to men is the open disapproval
of their fellows, and how, conversely, the outward
applause of their fellows is a stimulus surpassing all others in
intensity. Fully realizing which facts, he will see that the
immoralities of trade are in great part traceable to an
immoral public opinion.</p>

<p>Let none infer, from what has been said, that the payment
of respect to wealth rightly acquired and rightly used, is
deprecated. In its original meaning, and in due degree, the
feeling which prompts such respect is good. Primarily,
wealth is the sign of mental power; and this is always
respectable. To have honestly-acquired property, implies
intelligence, energy, self-control; and these are worthy of
the homage that is indirectly paid to them by admiring their
results. Moreover, the good ad­min­i­stra­tion and increase of
inherited property, also requires its virtues; and therefore
demands its share of approbation. And besides being
applauded for their display of faculty, men who gain and
increase wealth are to be applauded as public benefactors.
For he who, as manufacturer or merchant, has, without
injustice to others, realized a fortune, is thereby proved to
have discharged his functions better than those who have
been less successful. By greater skill, better judgment, or
more economy than his competitors, he has afforded the public
greater advantages. His extra profits are but a share of
the extra produce obtained by the same outlay: the other
share going to the consumers. And similarly, the landowner
who, by judicious investment of money, has increased the
value (that is, the productiveness) of his estate, has thereby
added to the stock of national capital. By
all means, then, <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
let the right acquisition and proper use of wealth have their
due share of admiration.</p>

<p>But that which we condemn as the chief cause of commercial
dishonesty, is the <i>indiscriminate</i> admiration of wealth—an
admiration that has little or no reference to the character
of the possessor. When, as generally happens, the external
signs are reverenced where they signify no internal worthiness—nay,
even where they cover internal unworthiness;
then does the feeling become vicious. It is this idolatry
which worships the symbol apart from the thing symbolized,
that is the root of all these evils we have been exposing. So
long as men pay homage to those social benefactors who have
grown rich honestly, they give a wholesome stimulus to
industry; but when they accord a share of their homage to
those social malefactors who have grown rich dishonestly,
then do they foster corruption—then do they become
accomplices in all these frauds of commerce.</p>

<p class="padtopb">As for remedy, it manifestly follows that there is none
save a purified public opinion. When that abhorrence
which society now shows to direct theft, is shown to theft
of all degrees of indirectness; then will these mercantile
vices disappear. When not only the trader who adulterates
or gives short measure, but also the merchant who over-trades,
the bank-director who countenances an exaggerated
report, and the railway-director who repudiates his
guarantee, come to be regarded as of the same genus as
the pickpocket, and are treated with like disdain; then will
the morals of trade become what they should be.</p>

<p>We have little hope, however, that any such higher tone
of public opinion will shortly be reached. The present
condition of things appears to be, in great measure, a
necessary accompaniment of our present phase of progress.
Throughout the civilized world, especially in England, and
above all in America, social activity is almost wholly
expended in material development.
To subjugate Nature <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
and bring the powers of production and distribution to their
highest perfection, is the task of our age, and probably will
be the task of many future ages. And as in times when
national defence and conquest were the chief desiderata,
military achievement was honoured above all other things;
so now, when the chief desideratum is industrial growth,
honour is most conspicuously given to that which generally
indicates the aiding of industrial growth. The English
nation at present displays what we may call the commercial
diathesis; and the undue admiration for wealth appears
to be its concomitant—a relation still more conspicuous in
the worship of “the almighty dollar” by the Americans.
And while the commercial diathesis, with its ac­com­pa­ny­ing
standard of distinction, continues, we fear the evils we have
been delineating can be but partially cured. It seems
hopeless to expect that men will distinguish between that
wealth which represents personal superiority and benefits
done to society, from that which does not. The symbols, the
externals, have all the world through swayed the masses,
and must long continue to do so. Even the cultivated, who
are on their guard against the bias of associated ideas, and
try to separate the real from the seeming, cannot escape the
influence of current opinion. We must therefore content
ourselves with looking for a slow amelioration.</p>

<p>Something, however, may even now be done by vigorous
protest against adoration of mere success. And it is important
that it should be done, considering how this vicious
sentiment is being fostered. When we have one of our
leading moralists preaching, with increasing vehemence, the
doctrine of sanctification by force—when we are told that
while a selfishness troubled with qualms of conscience is
contemptible, a selfishness intense enough to trample down
everything in the unscrupulous pursuit of its ends is worthy
of admiration—when we find that if it be sufficiently great,
power, no matter of what kind or how directed, is held up
for our reverence; we may fear lest
the prevalent applause <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
of mere success, together with the commercial vices which
it stimulates, should be increased rather than diminished.
Not at all by this hero-worship grown into brute-worship
is society to be made better, but by exactly the opposite—by
a stern criticism of the means through which success has
been achieved, and by according honour to the higher and
less selfish modes of activity.</p>

<p>And happily the signs of this more moral public opinion
are showing themselves. It is becoming a tacitly-received
doctrine that the rich should not, as in bygone times, spend
their lives in personal gratification; but should devote them
to the general welfare. Year by year is the improvement
of the people occupying a larger share of the attention of
the upper classes. Year by year are they voluntarily
devoting more energy to furthering the material and mental
progress of the masses. And those among them who do not
join in the discharge of these high functions, are beginning
to be looked upon with more or less contempt by their own
order. This latest and most hopeful fact in human history—this
new and better chivalry—promises to evolve a higher
standard of honour, and so to ameliorate many evils: among
others those which we have detailed. When wealth obtained
by illegitimate means inevitably brings nothing but disgrace—when
to wealth rightly acquired is accorded only its
due share of homage, while the greatest homage is given to
those who consecrate their energies and their means to
the noblest ends; then may we be sure that, along with
other ac­com­pa­ny­ing benefits, the morals of trade will be
greatly purified.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="h2nobreak">PRISON-ETHICS.</h2></div>

<div class="dchappre">
<p class="pfirst">[<i>First
published in</i> The British Quarterly Review <i>for July 1860</i>.]</p></div>

<p>The two antagonist theories of morals, like many other
antagonist theories, are both right and both wrong. The
<i>a priori</i> school has its truth; the <i>a posteriori</i> school has its
truth; and for the proper guidance of conduct, there must
be due recognition of both. On the one hand, it is
asserted that there is an absolute standard of rectitude;
and, respecting certain classes of actions, it is rightly so
asserted. From the fundamental laws of life and the
conditions of social existence, are deducible certain imperative
limitations to individual action—limitations which
are essential to a perfect life, individual and social; or,
in other words, essential to the greatest happiness. And
these limitations, following inevitably as they do from
undeniable first principles, deep as the nature of life itself,
constitute what we may distinguish as absolute morality.
On the other hand it is contended, and in a sense rightly
contended, that with men as they are and society as it is,
the dictates of absolute morality are impracticable. Legal
control, which involves infliction of pain, alike on those
who are restrained and on those who pay the cost of
restraining them, is proved by this fact to be not absolutely
moral; seeing that absolute morality is the regulation of
conduct in such way that pain shall
not be inflicted. <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span></p>

<p>Wherefore, if it be admitted that legal control is at present
indispensable, it must be admitted that these <i>a priori</i> rules
cannot be immediately carried out. And hence it follows
that we must adapt our laws and actions to the existing
character of mankind—that we must estimate the good or
evil resulting from this or that arrangement, and so reach,
<i>a posteriori</i>, a code fitted for the time being. In short, we
must fall back on expediency. Now, each of these positions
being valid, it is a grave mistake to adopt either
to the exclusion of the other. They should be respectively
appealed to for mutual qualification. Progressing civilization,
which is of necessity a succession of compromises
between old and new, requires a perpetual readjustment
of the compromise between the ideal and the practicable
in social arrangements: to which end both elements of the
compromise must be kept in view. If it is true that pure
rectitude prescribes a system of things too good for men
as they are; it is not less true that mere expediency does
not of itself tend to establish a system of things any
better than that which exists. While absolute morality
owes to expediency the checks which prevent it from
rushing into utopian absurdities; expediency is indebted
to absolute morality for all stimulus to improvement.
Granted that we are chiefly interested in ascertaining what
is <i>relatively right</i>; it still follows that we must first consider
what is <i>absolutely right</i>; since the one conception
presupposes the other. That is to say, though we must
ever aim to do what is best for the present times, yet we
must ever bear in mind what is abstractedly best; so that
the changes we make may be <i>towards</i> it, and not <i>away</i>
from it. Unattainable as pure rectitude is, and will long
continue to be, we must keep an eye on the compass which
tells us whereabout it lies; or we shall otherwise wander
in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Illustrations from our recent history will show very
conclusively, we think, how important
it is that <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
considerations of abstract expediency should be joined with those
of concrete expediency—how immense would be the evils
avoided and the benefits gained, if <i>a posteriori</i> morality
were enlightened by <i>a priori</i> morality. Take first the
case of free trade. Until recently it has been the practice
of all nations, artificially to restrict their commerce with
other nations. Throughout past centuries this course was
defensible as conducing to safety. Without saying that
law-givers had the motive of promoting industrial independence,
it may yet be said that in ages when national
quarrels were perpetual, it would not have been well
for any people to be much dependent on others for
necessary commodities. But though there is this ground
for asserting that commercial restrictions were once expedient,
it cannot be asserted that our corn-laws were thus
justified: it cannot be alleged that the penalties and
prohibitions which, until lately, hampered our trade, were
needful to prevent us from being industrially disabled by
a war. Protection in all its forms was established and
maintained for other reasons of expediency; and the
reasons for which it was opposed and finally abolished
were also those of expediency. Calculations of immediate
and remote consequences were set forth by the antagonist
parties; and the mode of decision was by a balancing of
these various anticipated consequences. And what, after
generations of mischievous legislation and long years of
arduous struggle, was the conclusion arrived at, and since
justified by the results? Exactly the one which abstract
equity plainly teaches. The moral course proves to be the
politic course. That ability to exercise the faculties, the
total denial of which causes death—that liberty to pursue
the objects of desire, without which there cannot be complete
life—that freedom of action which his nature prompts
every individual to claim, and on which equity puts no
limit save the like freedom of action of other individuals,
involves, among other corollaries,
freedom of exchange. <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
Government which, in protecting citizens from murder,
robbery, assault or other aggression, shows us that it has
the all-essential function of securing to each this free
exercise of faculties within the assigned limits, is called on,
in the due discharge of its function, to maintain this
freedom of exchange; and cannot abrogate it without
reversing its function, and becoming aggressor instead of
protector. Thus, absolute morality would all along have
shown in what direction legislation should tend. Qualified
only by the consideration that in turbulent times they
must not be so carried out as to endanger national life,
through suspensions in the supply of necessaries, these
<i>a priori</i> principles would have guided statesmen, as fast as
circumstances allowed, towards the normal condition. We
should have been saved from thousands of needless restrictions.
Such restrictions as were needful would have
been abolished as soon as was safe. An enormous amount
of suffering would have been prevented. That prosperity
which we now enjoy would have commenced much sooner.
And our present condition would have been one of greater
power, wealth, happiness, and morality.</p>

<p>Our railway-politics furnish another instance. A vast
loss of national capital has been incurred, and great misery
has been inflicted, in consequence of the neglect of a
simple principle clearly dictated by abstract justice. Whoso
enters into a contract, though he is bound to do that which
the contract specifies, is not bound to do some other thing
which is neither specified nor implied in the contract. We
do not appeal to moral perception only in warranty of this
position. It is one deducible from that first principle of
equity which, as above pointed out, follows from the laws
of life, individual and social; and it is one which the
accumulated experience of mankind has so uniformly
justified, that it has become a tacitly-recognized doctrine
of civil law among all nations. In cases of disputes about
agreements, the question in each case
brought to trial <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
always is, whether the terms bind one or other of the
contracting parties to do this or that; and it is assumed,
as a matter of course, that neither of them can be called
upon to do more than is expressed or understood in the
agreement. Now this almost self-evident principle has
been wholly ignored in railway-legislation. A shareholder,
uniting with others to make and work a line from one
specified place to another specified place, binds himself to
pay certain sums in furtherance of the project; and, by
implication, agrees to yield to the majority of his fellow-shareholders
on all questions raised respecting the execution
of this project. But he commits himself no further than
this. He is not required to obey the majority concerning
things not named in the deed of incorporation. Though
with respect to the specified railway he has bound himself,
he has not bound himself, with respect to any <i>un</i>specified
railway which his co-proprietors may wish to make; and he
cannot be committed to such unspecified railway by a vote
of the majority. But this distinction has been wholly passed
over. Shareholders in joint-stock undertakings have been
perpetually involved in other undertakings subsequently
decided on by their fellow-shareholders; and, against their
will, have had their properties heavily mortgaged for the
execution of projects that were ruinously unremunerative.
In every case the proprietary contract for making a
particular railway, has been dealt with as though it were a
proprietary contract for making railways! Not only have
directors thus misinterpreted it, and not only have shareholders
allowed it to be thus misinterpreted, but legislators
have so little understood their duties as to have endorsed
the mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tion. To this simple cause has been
owing most of our railway-companies’ disasters. Abnormal
facilities for getting capital have caused reckless competition
in extension-making and branch-making, and in
needless opposition lines, got up to be purchased by the
companies they threatened. Had each
new scheme been <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
executed by an independent body of shareholders, without
any guarantee from another company—without any capital
raised by preference shares—there would have been little
or none of the ruinous expenditure we have seen. Something
like a hundred millions of money would have been
saved, and thousands of families preserved from misery,
had the proprietary-contract been enforced according to
the dictates of pure equity.</p>

<p>These cases go far to justify our position. The general
reasons we gave for thinking that the ethics of immediate
experience must be enlightened by abstract ethics, to
ensure correct guidance, are strongly enforced by these
instances of the gigantic errors which are made when the
dictates of abstract ethics are ignored.
The complex estimates
of relative expediency, cannot do without the clue furnished
by the simple deductions of absolute expediency.</p>

<p class="padtopb">We propose to study the treatment of criminals from this
point of view. And first, let us set down those temporary
requirements which have hitherto prevented, and do still,
in part, prevent the establishment of a just system.</p>

<p>The same average popular character which necessitates a
rigorous form of government, necessitates also a rigorous
criminal code. Institutions are ultimately determined by
the natures of the citizens living under them; and when
these citizens are too impulsive or selfish for free institutions,
and unscrupulous enough to supply the requisite staff of
agents for maintaining tyrannical institutions, they are
proved by implication to be citizens who will tolerate, and
will probably need, severe forms of punishment. The
same mental defect underlies both results. The character
which originates and sustains political liberty, is a character
swayed by remote considerations—a character not at the
mercy of immediate temptations, but one which contemplates
the consequences likely to arise in future. We have only to
remember that, among ourselves, a
political encroachment is <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
resisted, not because of any direct evil it inflicts, but because
of the evils likely hereafter to flow from it, to see how the
maintenance of freedom presupposes the habit of weighing
distant results, and being chiefly guided by them. Conversely,
it is manifest that men who dwell only in the
present, the special, the concrete—who do not realize with
clearness the contingencies of the future—will put little
value on those rights of citizenship which profit them
nothing, save as a means of warding off unspecified evils
that can possibly affect them only at a distant time in an
obscure way. Well, is it not obvious that the forms of
mind thus contrasted, will require different kinds of punishment
for misconduct? To restrain the second, there must
be penalties which are severe, prompt, and specific enough
to be vividly conceived; while the first may be deterred by
penalties which are less definite, less intense, less immediate.
For the more civilized, dread of a long, monotonous,
criminal discipline may suffice; but for the less civilized
there must be inflictions of bodily pain and death. Thus
we hold, not only that a social condition which generates a
harsh form of government, also generates harsh retributions;
but also, that in such a social condition, harsh
retributions are requisite. And there are facts which
illustrate this. Witness the case of one of the Italian
states, in which the punishment of death having been
abolished in conformity with the wish of a dying duchess,
assassinations increased so greatly that it became needful
to re-establish it.</p>

<p>Besides the fact that in the less-advanced stages of
civilization, a bloody penal code is both a natural product
of the time and a needful restraint for the time, there
must be noted the fact that a more equitable and humane
code could not be carried out from want of fit ad­min­i­stra­tion.
To deal with delinquents not by short and sharp methods
but by such methods as abstract justice indicates, implies a
class of agencies too complicated to exist in
a low society, <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
and a class of officers more trustworthy than can be found
among its citizens. Especially would the equitable treatment
of criminals be impracticable where the amount of
crime was very great. The number to be dealt with would
be unmanageable. Some simpler method of purging the
community of its worst members becomes, under such
circumstances, a necessity.</p>

<p>The inapplicability of an absolutely just system of penal
discipline to a barbarous or semi-barbarous people, is thus,
we think, as manifest as is the inapplicability of an absolutely
just form of government to them. And in the same manner
that, for some nations, a despotism is warranted; so may a
criminal code of the extremest severity be warranted. In
either case the defence is, that the institution is as good
as the average character of the people permits—that less
stringent institutions would entail social confusion and its
far more severe evils. Bad as a despotism is, yet where
anarchy is the only alternative, we must say that, as anarchy
would bring greater suffering than despotism brings, despotism
is justified by the circumstances. And similarly,
however inequitable in the abstract were the beheadings,
crucifyings, and burnings of ruder ages, yet, if it be shown
that, without penalties thus extreme, the safety of society
could not have been insured—if, in their absence, the
increase of crime would have inflicted a larger total of evil,
and that, too, on peaceable members of the community;
then it follows that morality warranted this severity. In
the one case, as in the other, we must say that, measured
by the quantities of pain respectively inflicted and avoided,
the course pursued was the <i>least wrong</i>; and to say that it
was the least wrong is to say that it was <i>relatively right</i>.</p>

<p>But while we thus admit all that can be alleged by the
defenders of Draconian codes, we go on to assert a correlative
truth which they overlook. While fully recognizing
the evils that must follow the premature
establishment of a <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
penal system dictated by pure equity, let us not overlook
the evils that have arisen from altogether rejecting the
guidance of pure equity. Let us note how terribly the
one-sided regard for immediate expediency has retarded
the ameliorations from time to time demanded.</p>

<p>Consider, for instance, the immense amount of suffering
and demoralization needlessly caused by our severe laws in
the last century. Those many merciless penalties which
Romilly and others succeeded in abolishing, were as little
justified by social necessities as by abstract morality.
Experience has since proved that to hang men for theft,
was not requisite for the security of property. And that
such a measure was opposed to pure equity, scarcely needs
saying. Evidently, had considerations of relative expediency
been all along qualified by considerations of absolute
expediency, these severities, with their many concomitant
evils, would have ceased long before they did.</p>

<p>Again, the dreadful misery, demoralization, and crime,
generated by the harsh treatment of transported convicts,
would have been impossible, had our authorities considered
what seemed just as well as what seemed politic. There
would never have been inflicted on transports the shocking
cruelties proved before the Parliamentary Committee of
1848. We should not have had men condemned to the
horrors of the chain-gang even for insolent looks. There
could not have been perpetrated such an atrocity as that of
locking up chain-gangs “from sunset to sunrise in the
caravans or boxes used for this description of prisons,
which hold from twenty to twenty-eight men, but in which
the whole number <i>can neither stand upright nor sit down at
the same time, except with their legs at right angles to their
bodies</i>.” Men would never have been doomed to tortures
extreme enough to produce despair, desperation, and
further crimes—tortures under which “a man’s heart is
taken from him, and there is given to him the
heart of a <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
beast,” as said by one of these law-produced criminals
before his execution. We should not have been told, as
by a chief justice of Australia, that the discipline was
“carried to an extent of <i>suffering, such as to render death
desirable, and to induce many prisoners to seek it under its
most appalling aspects</i>.” Sir G. Arthur would not have
had to testify that, in Van Diemen’s Land, convicts committed
murder for the purpose “<i>of being sent up to Hobart
Town for trial, though aware that in the ordinary course they
must be executed within a fortnight after arrival</i>;” nor
would tears of commiseration have been drawn from Judge
Burton’s eyes, by one of these cruelly-used transports
placed before him for sentence. In brief, had abstract
equity joined with immediate expediency in devising
convict discipline, not only would untold suffering, degradation,
and mortality have been prevented; but those who
were responsible for atrocities like those above-named,
would not themselves be chargeable with crime, as we now
hold them to be.</p>

<p>Probably we shall meet with a less general assent when,
as a further benefit which the guidance of absolute morality
would have conferred, we instance the prevention of such
methods as those in use at Pentonville. How the silent
and the separate systems are negatived by abstract justice
we shall by and by see. For the present, the position we
have to defend is that these systems are bad. That but a
moderate per-centage of the prisoners subjected to them
are re-convicted, may be true; though, considering the
fallaciousness of negative statistics, this by no means proves
that those not re-convicted are reformed. But the question
is not solely how many prisoners are prevented from again
committing crime? A further question is, how many of
them have become self-supporting members of society? It
is notorious that this prolonged denial of human intercourse
not unfrequently produces insanity or imbecility; and on
those who remain sane, its depressing
influence must almost <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
of necessity entail serious debility, bodily and mental.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn7" id="fnanch7">7</a>
Indeed, we think it probable that much of the apparent
success is due to an enfeeblement which incapacitates for
crime as much as for industry. Our own objection to such
methods, however, has always been, that their effect on
the moral nature is the reverse of that required. Crime is
anti-social—is prompted by self-regarding feelings and
checked by social feelings. The natural prompter of right
conduct to others, and the natural opponent of misconduct
to others, is sympathy; for out of sympathy grow both
the kindly emotions, and that sentiment of justice which
restrains us from aggressions. Well, this sympathy,
which makes society possible, is cultivated by social intercourse.
By habitual participation in the pleasures of
others, the faculty is strengthened; and whatever prevents
this participation, weakens it. Hence, therefore, shutting
up prisoners within themselves, or forbidding all interchange
of feeling, inevitably deadens such sympathies as they
have; and so tends rather to diminish than to increase the
moral check to transgression. This <i>a priori</i> conviction,
which we have long entertained, we now find confirmed by
facts. Captain Maconochie states, as a result of observation,
that a long course of separation so fosters the self-regarding
desires, and so weakens the sympathies, as to
make even well-disposed men very unfit to bear the little
trials of domestic life on their return to their homes.
Thus there is good reason to think that, while silence and
solitude may cow the spirit or undermine the energies, it
cannot produce true reformation.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch7" id="fn7">7</a>
Mr. Baillie-Cochrane says:—“The officers at
the Dartmoor prison inform me that the prisoners who arrive
there even after one year’s confinement at Pentonville,
may be distinguished from the others by their miserable
downcast look. In most instances their brain is affected;
and they are unable to give satisfactory replies to the
simplest questions.”</p></div>

<p>“But how can it be shown,” asks the reader, “that these
injudicious penal systems are inequitable? Where is the
method which will enable us to
say what kind of <span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span>
punishment is justified by absolute morality, and what kind is
not?” These questions we will now attempt to answer.</p>

<p class="padtopb">So long as the individual citizen pursues the objects of
his desires without diminishing the equal freedom of any of
his fellow citizens to do the like, society cannot equitably
interfere with him. While he contents himself with the
benefits won by his own energies, and attempts not to
intercept any of the benefits similarly won for themselves
by others, or any of those which Nature has conferred on
them; no legal penalties can rightly be inflicted on him.
But when, by murder, theft, assault, arson, or minor
aggression, he has broken through these limits, the community
is warranted in putting him under restraint. On
the relative propriety of doing this we need say nothing:
it is demonstrated by social experience. Its absolute
propriety not being so manifest, we will proceed to point
out how it is deducible from the ultimate laws of life.</p>

<p>Life depends on the maintenance of certain natural
relations between actions and their results. If respiration
does not supply oxygen to the blood, as in the normal order
of things it should do, but instead supplies carbonic acid,
death quickly results. If the swallowing of food is not
followed by the usual organic sequences—the contractions
of the stomach, and the pouring into it of gastric juice—indigestion
arises, and the energies flag. If active movements
of the limbs fail in exciting the heart to supply blood
more rapidly, or if the extra current propelled by the heart
is greatly retarded by an aneurism through which it passes,
speedy prostration ensues. In which, and endless like
cases, we see that bodily life depends on the maintenance
of the established connexions between physiological causes
and their consequences. Among the intellectual processes,
the same thing holds. If certain impressions made on the
senses do not induce the appropriate muscular adjustments—if
the brain is clouded with wine,
or consciousness is <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
pre-occupied, or the perceptions are naturally obtuse; the
movements are so ill-controlled that accidents happen.
Where, as in paralytic patients, the natural link between
mental impressions and the appropriate motions is broken,
the life is greatly vitiated. And when, as during insanity,
evidence fitted, according to the usual order of thought, to
produce certain convictions, produces convictions of an
opposite kind, conduct is reduced to chaos, and life
endangered—perhaps cut short. So it is with more involved
phenomena. Just as we here find that, throughout both
its physical and intellectual divisions, healthful life implies
continuance of the established successions of antecedents
and consequents among our vital actions; so shall we find
it throughout the moral division. In our dealings with
external Nature and our fellow men, there are relations of
cause and effect, on the maintenance of which, as on the
maintenance of the internal ones above instanced, life
depends. Conduct of this or that kind tends to bring
results which are pleasurable or painful; and the welfare of
every one demands that these natural sequences shall not
be interfered with. To speak more specifically, we see that
in the order of Nature, inactivity entails want. There is a
connexion between exertion and the fulfilment of certain
imperative needs. If, now, this connexion is broken—if
labour of body or mind has been gone through, and the
produce of the labour is intercepted by another, one of the
conditions to complete life is unfulfilled. The defrauded
person is physically injured by deprivation of the wherewithal
to make good the wear and tear he had undergone;
and if the robbery be continually repeated, he must die.
Where all men are dishonest a reflex evil results. When,
throughout a society, the normal relation between work
and benefit is habitually broken, not only are the lives of
many directly undermined, but the lives of all are indirectly
undermined by destruction of the motive for work, and by
the consequent poverty. Thus, to demand
that there shall <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
be no breach of the natural sequence between labour and
the rewards obtained by labour, is to demand that the laws
of life shall be respected. What we call the right of
property, is simply a corollary from certain necessary
conditions to complete living. It is a formulated recognition
of the relation between expenditure of force and the
need for force-sustaining objects obtainable by the expenditure
of force—a recognition in full of a relation which
cannot be wholly ignored without causing death. And all
else regarded as individual rights, are indirect implications
of like nature—similarly insist on certain relations between
man and man, as conditions without which there cannot be
fully maintained that correspondence between inner and outer
actions which constitutes life. It is not, as some moralists
and most lawyers absurdly assert, that such rights are derived
from human legislation; nor is it, as asserted by others with
absurdity almost as great, that there is no basis for them save
the inductions of immediate expediency. These rights are
deducible from the established connexions between our acts
and their results. As certainly as there are conditions which
must be fulfilled before life can exist, so certainly are
there conditions which must be fulfilled before complete
life can be enjoyed by the respective members of a society;
and those which we call the requirements of justice, simply
answer to the most important of such conditions.</p>

<p>Hence, if life is our legitimate aim—if absolute morality
means, as it does, conformity to the laws of complete life;
then absolute morality warrants the restraint of those who
force their fellow-citizens into non-conformity. Our justification
is, that life is impossible save under certain conditions;
that it cannot be entire unless these conditions are maintained
unbroken; and that if it is right for us to live completely,
it is right for us to remove any one who either
breaks these conditions in our persons or constrains us to
break them.</p>

<p>Such being the basis of our right to
coerce the criminal, <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
there next come the questions:—What is the legitimate
extent of the coercion? Can we from this source derive
authority for certain demands on him? and are there any
similarly-derived limits to such demands? To both these
questions there are affirmative answers.</p>

<p>First, we find authority for demanding restitution or compensation.
Conformity to the laws of life being the substance
of absolute morality; and the social regulations which
absolute morality dictates, being those which make this
conformity possible; it is a manifest corollary that whoever
breaks these regulations, may be justly required to undo,
as far as possible, the wrong he has done. The object
being to maintain the conditions essential to complete life,
it follows that, when one of these conditions has been transgressed,
the first thing to be required of the transgressor
is, that he shall put matters as nearly as may be in the state
they previously were. The property stolen shall be restored,
or an equivalent for it given. Any one injured by an
assault shall have his surgeon’s bill paid, compensation for
lost time, and also for the suffering he has borne. And
similarly in all cases of infringed rights.</p>

<p>Second, we are warranted by this highest authority in
restricting the actions of the offender as much as is needful to
prevent further aggressions. Any citizen who will not allow
others to fulfil the conditions to complete life—who takes
away the produce of his neighbour’s labour, or deducts from
that bodily health and comfort which his neighbour has
earned by good conduct, must be forced to desist. And society
is warranted in using such force as may be found requisite.
Equity justifies the fellow-citizens of such a man in limiting
the free exercise of his faculties to the extent necessary for
preserving the free exercise of their own faculties.</p>

<p>But now mark that absolute morality countenances no
restraint beyond this—no gratuitous inflictions of pain, no
revengeful penalties. The conditions it insists on being such
as make possible complete life, we
cannot rightly abrogate <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
these conditions, even in the person of a criminal, further
than is needful to prevent greater abrogations of them.
Freedom to fulfil the laws of life being the thing insisted on,
to the end that the sum of life may be the greatest possible,
it follows that the life of the offender must be taken into
account as an item in this sum. We must permit him to
live as completely as consists with social safety. It is
commonly said that the criminal loses all his rights. This
may be so according to law, but it is not so according to
justice. Such portion of them only is justly taken away,
as cannot be left to him without danger to the community.
Those exercises of faculty, and consequent benefits, which
are possible under the necessary restraint, cannot be equitably
denied. If any do not think it proper that we should
be thus regardful of an offender’s claims, let them consider
for a moment the lesson which Nature reads us. We do
not find that those processes of life by which bodily health
is maintained, are miraculously suspended in the person of
the prisoner. In him, as in others, good digestion waits on
appetite. If he is wounded, the healing process goes on
with the usual rapidity. When he is ill, as much effect is
expected from the <i>vis medicatrix naturæ</i> by the medical
officer, as in one who has not transgressed. His perceptions
yield him guidance as they did before he was imprisoned;
and he is capable of much the same pleasurable emotions.
When we thus see that the beneficent arrangements of things,
are no less uniformly sustained in his person than in that
of another, are we not bound to respect in his person such
of these beneficent arrangements as we have power to
thwart? are we not bound to interfere with the laws of life
no further than is needful? If any still hesitate, there is
another lesson for them having the same implication.
Whoso disregards any one of those simpler laws of life out
of which, as we have shown, the moral laws originate, has
to bear the evil necessitated by the transgression—just that,
and no more. If, careless of your footing,
you fall, the <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
consequent bruise, and possibly some constitutional disturbance
entailed by it, are all you have to suffer: there is not
the further gratuitous penalty of a cold or an attack of
small-pox. If you have eaten something which you know
to be indigestible, there follow certain visceral derangements
and their concomitants; but, for your physical sin,
there is no vengeance in the shape of a broken bone or a
spinal affection. The punishments, in these and other cases,
are neither greater nor less than flow from the natural
workings of things. Well, should we not with all humility
follow this example? Must we not infer that, similarly, a
citizen who has transgressed the conditions to social welfare,
ought to bear the needful penalties and restraints, but
nothing beyond these? Is it not clear that neither by absolute
morality nor by Nature’s precedents, are we warranted in
visiting on him any pains besides those involved in remedying,
as far as may be, the evil committed, and preventing
other such evils? To us it seems manifest that if society
exceeds this, it trespasses against the criminal.</p>

<p>Those who think that we are tending towards a mischievous
leniency, will find that the next step in our argument
disposes of any such objection; for while equity
forbids us to punish the criminal otherwise than by making
him suffer the natural consequences, these, when rigorously
enforced, are quite severe enough.</p>

<p>Society having proved in the high court of absolute
morality, that the offender must make restitution or compensation,
and submit to the restraints requisite for public
safety; and the offender having obtained from the same
court the decision, that these restraints shall be no greater
than the specified end requires; society thereupon makes
the further demand that, while living in durance, the
offender shall maintain himself; and this demand absolute
morality at once endorses. The community having taken
measures for self-preservation, and having inflicted on the
aggressor no punishments or
disabilities beyond those <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
involved in these necessary measures, is no further concerned
in the matter. With the support of the prisoner it has no
more to do than before he committed the crime. It is the
business of society simply to defend itself against him;
and it is his business to live as well as he can under the
restrictions society is obliged to impose on him. All he
may rightly ask is, to have the opportunity of labouring,
and exchanging the produce of his labour for necessaries;
and this claim is a corollary from that already admitted,
that his actions shall not be restricted more than is needful
for the public safety. With these opportunities, however,
he must make the best of his position. He must be content
to gain as good a livelihood as the circumstances permit;
and if he cannot employ his powers to the best advantage,
if he has to work hard and fare scantily, these evils must
be counted among the penalties of his transgression—the
natural reactions of his wrong action.</p>

<p>On this self-maintenance equity sternly insists. The
reasons which justify his imprisonment, equally justify the
refusal to let him have any other sustenance than he earns.
He is confined that he may not further interfere with the
complete living of his fellow-citizens—that he may not
again intercept any of those benefits which the order of
Nature has conferred on them, or any of those procured by
their exertions and careful conduct. And he is required
to support himself for exactly the same reasons—that he
may not interfere with others’ complete living—that he
may not intercept the benefits they earn. For, if otherwise,
whence must come his food and clothing? Directly from
the public stores, and indirectly from the pockets of all
tax-payers. And what is the property thus abstracted
from tax-payers? It is the equivalent of so much benefit
earned by labour. It is so much means to complete living.
And when this property is taken away—when the toil has
been gone through, and the produce of it is intercepted by
the tax-gatherer on behalf of the convict;
the conditions to <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
complete life are broken: the convict commits by deputy
a further aggression on his fellow-citizens. It matters not
that such abstraction is made according to law. We are
here considering the <i>dictum</i> of that authority which is
above law; and which law ought to enforce. And this
<i>dictum</i> we find to be, that each individual shall take the
evils and benefits of his own conduct—that the offender
must suffer, as far as is possible, all pains entailed by his
offence; and must not be allowed to visit part of them on
the unoffending. Unless the criminal maintains himself, he
indirectly commits an additional crime. Instead of repairing
the breach he has made in the conditions to complete
social life, he widens this breach. He inflicts on others
that very injury which the restraint imposed on him was
to prevent. As certainly, therefore, as such restraint is
warranted by absolute morality; so certainly does absolute
morality warrant us in refusing him gratuitous support.</p>

<p>These, then, are the requirements of an equitable penal
system:—That the aggressor shall make restitution or compensation;
that he shall be placed under the restraints
requisite for social security; that neither any restraints
beyond these, nor any gratuitous penalties, shall be inflicted
on him; and that while living in confinement, or under
surveillance, he shall maintain himself. We are not
prepared to say that such dictates may at once be fully
obeyed. Already we have admitted that the deductions of
absolute expediency must, in our transition state, be
qualified by the inductions of relative expediency. We
have pointed out that in rude times, the severest criminal
codes were morally justified if, without them, crime could
not be repressed and social safety insured. Whence, by
implication, it follows that our present methods of treating
criminals are warranted, if they come as near to those of
pure equity as circumstances permit. That any system
now feasible must fall short of the ideal sketched out, is
probable. It may be that the enforcement
of restitution or <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
compensation, is in many cases impracticable. It may be
that on some convicts, penalties more severe than abstract
justice demands must be inflicted. On the other hand, it
may be that entire self-maintenance would entail on the
wholly-unskilled criminal, a punishment too grievous to be
borne. But any such shortcomings do not affect our
argument. All we insist on is, that the commands of
absolute morality shall be obeyed as far as possible—that
we shall fulfil them up to those limits beyond which experiment
proves that more evil than good results—that, ever
keeping in view the ideal, each change we make shall be
towards its realization.</p>

<p class="padtopb">But now we are prepared to say, that this ideal may be
in great part realized at the present time. Experience in
various countries, under various circumstances, has shown
that immense benefits result from substituting for the old
penal systems, systems that approximate to that above
indicated. Germany, France, Spain, England, Ireland,
and Australia, send statements to the effect that the most
successful criminal discipline, is a discipline of decreased
restraints and increased self-dependence. And the evidence
proves the success to be greatest, where the nearest
approach is made to the arrangements prescribed by
abstract justice. We shall find the facts striking: some of
them even astonishing.</p>

<p>When M. Obermair was appointed Governor of the
Munich State-Prison―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“He found from 600 to 700 prisoners in the jail, in the worst state of
insubordination, and whose excesses, he was told, defied the harshest and
most stringent discipline; the prisoners were all chained together, and
attached to each chain was an iron weight, which the strongest found
difficulty in dragging along. The guard consisted of about 100 soldiers,
who did duty not only at the gates and around the walls, but also in the
passages, and even in the workshops and dormitories; and, strangest of all
protections against the possibility of an outbreak or individual invasion,
twenty to thirty large savage dogs, of the bloodhound breed, were let
loose at night in the passages and courts to keep their
watch and ward. <span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span>
According to his account the place was a perfect Pandemonium, comprising,
within the limits of a few acres, the worst passions, the most slavish vices,
and the most heartless tyranny.”</p></blockquote>

<p>M. Obermair gradually relaxed this harsh system. He
greatly lightened the chains; and would, if allowed, have
thrown them aside. The dogs, and nearly all the guards,
were dispensed with; and the prisoners were treated with
such consideration as to gain their confidence. Mr. Baillie-Cochrane,
who visited the place in 1852, says the prison-gates
were</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“Wide open, without any sentinel at the door, and a guard of only twenty
men idling away their time in a guard-room off the entrance-hall. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
None of the doors were provided with bolts and bars; the only security was
an ordinary lock, and as in most of the rooms the key was not turned, there
was no obstacle to the men walking into the passage. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Over each
workshop some of the prisoners with the best characters were appointed
overseers, and M. Obermair assured me that if a prisoner transgressed a
regulation, his companions generally told him, ‘Es ist verboten’ (it is
forbidden), and it rarely happened that he did not yield to the opinion of his
fellow-prisoners. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Within the prison walls every description of work is
carried on; the prisoners, divided into different gangs and supplied with
instruments and tools, make their own clothes, repair their own prison walls,
and forge their own chains, producing various specimens of manufacture
which are turned to most excellent account—the result being, that each
prisoner, by occupation and industry, maintains himself; the surplus of his
earnings being given him on his emancipation, avoids his being parted with
in a state of destitution.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And further, the prisoners “associate in their leisure
hours, without any check on their intercourse, but at the
same time under an efficient system of observation and
control”—an arrangement by which, after many years’
experience, M. Obermair asserts that morality is increased.</p>

<p>And now what has been the result? During his six-years’
government of the Kaiserslauten (the first prison
under his care), M. Obermair discharged 132 criminals, of
which number 123 have since conducted themselves well,
and 7 have been recommitted. From the Munich prison,
between 1843 and 1845, 298 prisoners were discharged.</p>

<p>Of these, 246 have been restored, improved, to society.
Those whose characters are doubtful, but
have not been <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
remanded for any criminal act, 26; again under examination,
4; punished by the police, 6; remanded, 8; died, 8.
This statement, says M. Obermair, “is based on irrefutable
evidence.” And to the reality of his success,
we have the testimony not only of Mr. Baillie-Cochrane,
but of the Rev. C. H. Townsend, Mr. George Combe,
Mr. Matthew Hill, and Sir John Milbanke, our Envoy at
the Court of Bavaria.</p>

<p>Take, again, the case of Mettray. Every one has heard
something about Mettray, and its success as a reformatory
of juvenile criminals. Observe how nearly the successful
system there pursued, conforms to the abstract principles
above enunciated.</p>

<p>This “Colonie Agricole” is “without wall or enclosure
of any sort, for the purposes at least of confinement;” and
except when for some fault a child is temporarily put in a
cell, there is no physical restraint. The life is industrial:
the boys being brought up to trades or agriculture as they
prefer; and all the domestic services being discharged
by them. “They all do their work by the <i>piece</i>;” are
rewarded according to the judgment of the <i>chef d’atelier</i>;
and, a portion being placed at the disposal of the child,
the rest is deposited in the savings-bank at Tours. “A
boy in receipt of any money has to make payment for any
part of his dress which requires to be renewed before the
stated time arrives at which fresh clothing is given out;
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on the other hand, if his clothes are found in good
condition at such time, he receives the benefit of it by
having the money which would have been laid out in
clothes placed to his account. Two hours per day are
allowed for play. Part-singing is taught; and if a boy
shows any turn for drawing he receives a little instruction
in it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some of the boys also are formed into a
fire-brigade, and have rendered at times substantial assistance
in the neighbourhood.” In which few leading facts
do we not clearly see that
the essential peculiarities <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
are—no more restraint than is absolutely necessary; self-support
as far as possible; extra benefits earned by extra labour;
and as much gratifying exercise of faculties as the circumstances
permit.</p>

<p>The “intermediate system” which has of late been
carried out with much success in Ireland, exemplifies, in a
degree, the practicability of the same general principles.
Under this system, prisoners working as artizans are
allowed “such a modified degree of liberty as shall in
various ways prove their power of self-denial and self-dependence,
in a manner wholly incompatible with the
rigid restraints of an ordinary prison.” An offender who
has passed through this stage of probation, is tested by
employment “on messenger’s duties daily throughout the
city, and also in special works required by the department
outside the prison-walls. The performance of the duties
of messengers entails their being out until seven or eight
in the evening, unaccompanied by an officer; and although
a small portion of their earnings is allowed them weekly,
and they would have the power of compromising themselves
if so disposed, not one instance has as yet taken place of
the slightest irregularity, or even the want of punctuality,
although careful checks have been contrived to detect
either, should it occur.” A proportion of their prison-earnings
is set aside for them in a savings-bank; and to
this they are encouraged to add during their period of
partial freedom, with a view to subsequent emigration.
The results are:—“In the penitentiary the greatest possible
order and regularity, and an amount of willing industry
performed that cannot be obtained in the prisons.”
Employers to whom prisoners are eventually transferred,
“have on many occasions returned for others in consequence
of the good conduct of those at first engaged.”
And according to Captain Crofton’s pamphlet of 1857, out
of 112 conditionally discharged during the previous year,
85 were going on satisfactorily, “9
have been discharged <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
too recently to be spoken of, and 5 have had their licences
revoked. As to the remaining 13, it has been found
impossible to obtain accurate information, but it is supposed
that 5 have left the country, and 3 enlisted.”</p>

<p>The “mark system” of Captain Maconochie, is one
which more fully carries out the principle of self-maintenance,
under restraints no greater than are needful for
safety. The plan is to join with time-sentences certain
labour-sentences—specific tasks to be worked out by the
convicts. “No rations, or other supplies of any kind,
whether of food, bedding, clothing, or even education or
indulgences, to be given <i>gratuitously</i>, but all to be made
exchangeable, at fixed rates, at the prisoners’ own option,
for marks previously earned; it being understood, at the
same time, that only those shall count towards liberation
which remain over and above all so exchanged; the
prisoners being thus caused to depend for every necessary
on their own good conduct; and their prison-offences to be
in like manner restrained by corresponding fines imposed
according to the measures of each.” The use of marks,
which thus play the part of money, was first introduced by
Captain Maconochie in Norfolk Island. Describing the
working of his method, he says―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“First, it gave me wages and then fines. One gave me willing and
progressively-skilled labourers, and the other saved me from the necessity of
imposing brutal and demoralizing punishments. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My form of money
next gave me school fees. I was most anxious to encourage education
among my men, but as I refused them rations gratuitously, so I would not
give them schooling either, but compelled them to yield marks to acquire it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I never saw adult schools make such rapid progress. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My form
of money next gave me bailbonds in cases of minor or even great offences;
a period of close imprisonment being wholly or in part remitted in consideration
of a sufficient number of other prisoners of good character
becoming bound, under a penalty, for the improved conduct
of the culprit.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Even in the establishment of a sick-club and a burial-club,
Captain Maconochie applied “the inflexible principle
of giving nothing for nothing.” That is to say, here, as
throughout, he made the discipline of
the prisoners as <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span>
much like the discipline of ordinary life as possible: let
them experience just such good or evil as naturally flowed
from their conduct—a principle which he rightly asserts is
the only true one. What were the effects? The extreme
debasement of Norfolk Island convicts was notorious; and
on a preceding page we have described some of the
horrible sufferings inflicted on them. Yet, starting with
these most demoralized of criminals, Captain Maconochie
obtained highly-favourable results. “In four years,” he
says, “I discharged 920 doubly-convicted men to Sydney,
of whom only 20, or 2 per cent., had been re-convicted up
to January, 1845;” while, at the same time, the ordinary
proportion of re-convicted Van Diemen’s Land men,
otherwise trained, was 9 per cent. “Captain Maconochie,”
writes Mr. Harris in his <i>Settlers and Convicts</i>, “did more
for the reformation of these unhappy wretches, and
amelioration of their physical circumstances, than the
most sanguine practical mind could beforehand have ventured
even to hope.” Another witness says—“a reformation
far greater than has been hitherto effected in any body of
men by any system, either before or after yours, has taken
place in them.” “As pastor of the island, and for two
years a magistrate, I can prove that at no period was
there so little crime,” writes the Rev. B. Naylor. And
Thomas H. Dixon, Chief Superintendent of Convicts in
Western Australia, who partially introduced the system
there in 1856, asserts that not only was the amount of
work done under it extraordinary, but that “even although
the characters of some of the party were by no means
good previously (many of them being men whose licences
had been revoked in England), yet the transformation
which in this and all other respects they underwent,
was very remarkable indeed.” If such were the results,
when the method was imperfectly carried out (for the
Government all along refused to give any fixed value
to the marks as a means to liberation);
what might be <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span>
expected if its motives and restraints were allowed their
full influence?</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, of all evidence, the most conclusive is
that afforded by the prison of Valencia. When, in 1835,
Colonel Montesinos was appointed governor, “the average
of re-committals was from 30 to 35 per cent. per annum—nearly
the same that is found in England and other
countries in Europe; but such has been the success of his
method, that for the last three years <i>there has not been even
one re-committal to it</i>, and for the ten previous years they
did not, on an average, exceed 1 per cent.” And how
has this marvellous change been brought about? By
diminished restraint and industrial discipline. The following
extracts, taken irregularly from Mr. Hoskins’s <i>Account
of the Public Prison at Valencia</i>, will prove this:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“When first the convict enters the establishment he wears chains, but
on his application to the commander they are taken off, unless he has not
conducted himself well.”</p>

<p>“There are a thousand prisoners, and in the whole establishment I did
not see above three or four guardians to keep them in order. They say
there are only a dozen old soldiers, and not a bar or bolt that might not be
easily broken—apparently not more fastenings than in any private house.”</p>

<p>“When a convict enters, he is asked what trade or employment he will
work at or learn, and above forty are open to him. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There are
weavers and spinners of every description; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. blacksmiths, shoemakers,
basketmakers, ropemakers, joiners, cabinetmakers, making handsome
mahogany drawers; and they had also a printing machine hard at work.”</p>

<p>“The labour of every description for the repair, rebuilding, and cleaning
the establishment, is supplied by the convicts. They were all most respectful
in demeanour, and certainly I never saw such a good-looking set of
prisoners, useful occupations (and other considerate treatment) having
apparently improved their countenances. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [And besides a] garden for
exercise planted with orange trees, there was also a poultry yard for their
amusement, with pheasants and various other kinds of birds; washing-houses,
where they wash their clothes; and a shop, where they can purchase,
if they wish, tobacco and other little comforts out of one-fourth of the
profits of their labour, which is given to them. Another fourth they are
entitled to when they leave; the other half goes to the establishment,
and <i>often this is sufficient for all expenses, without any assistance from
the Government</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the highest success, regarded by
Mr. Hoskins as <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
“really a miracle,” is achieved by a system most nearly
conforming to those dictates of absolute morality on which
we have insisted. The convicts are almost, if not quite,
self-supporting. They are subject neither to gratuitous
penalties nor unnecessary restrictions. While made to earn
their living, they are allowed to purchase such enjoyments
as consist with their confinement: the avowed principle
being, in the words of Colonel Montesinos, to “give as
much latitude to their free agency as can be made conformable
to discipline at all.” Thus they are (as we found
that equity required they should be) allowed to live as
satisfactorily as they can, under such restraints only as are
needful for the safety of their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>To us it appears extremely significant that there should
be so close a correspondence between <i>a priori</i> conclusions,
and the results of experiments tried without reference to
such conclusions. On the one hand, neither in the doctrines
of pure equity with which we set out, nor in the corollaries
drawn from them, is there any mention of criminal-reformation:
our concern has been solely with the rights
of citizens and convicts in their mutual relations. On the
other hand, those who have carried out the improved penal
systems above described, have had almost solely in view
the improvement of the offender: the just claims of society,
and of those who sin against it, having been left out of
the question. Yet the methods which have succeeded so
marvellously in decreasing criminality, are the methods
which most nearly fulfil the requirements of abstract justice.</p>

<p>That the most equitable system is the one best calculated
to reform the offender, may indeed be deductively shown.
The internal experience of every one must prove to him,
that excessive punishment begets, not penitence, but indignation
and hatred. So long as an aggressor suffers nothing
beyond the evils which have naturally resulted from his
misconduct—so long as he perceives that his fellow-men
have done no more than was
needful for self-defence—he <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
has no excuse for anger; and is led to contemplate his
crime and his punishment as cause and effect. But if
gratuitous sufferings are inflicted on him, a sense of
injustice is produced. He regards himself as an injured
man. He cherishes animosity against all who have brought
this harsh treatment on him. Glad of any plea for forgetting
the injury he has done to others, he dwells instead on
the injury others have done to him. Thus nurturing a
desire for revenge rather than atonement, he re-enters
society not better but worse; and if he does not commit
further crimes, as he often does, he is restrained by the
lowest of motives—fear. Again, this industrial discipline,
to which criminals subject themselves under a purely
equitable system, is the discipline they especially need.
Speaking generally, we are all compelled to work by the
necessities of our social existence. For most of us this
compulsion suffices; but there are some whose aversion to
labour cannot be thus overcome. Not labouring, and yet
needing sustenance, they are compelled to obtain it in
illegitimate ways; and so bring on themselves the legal
penalties. The criminal class being thus in great part
recruited from the idle class; and the idleness being the
source of the criminality; it follows that a successful
discipline must be one which shall cure the idleness. The
natural compulsions to labour having been eluded, the
thing required is that the offender shall be so placed that
he cannot elude them. And this is just what is done
under the system we advocate. Its action is such that
men whose natures are ill-adapted to the conditions of
social life, bring themselves into a position in which a
better adaptation is forced on them by the alternative of
starvation. Lastly, let us not forget that this discipline
which absolute morality dictates, is salutary, not only
because it is industrial, but because it is voluntarily industrial.
As we have shown, equity requires that the confined
criminal shall be left to maintain himself—that
is, shall be <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span>
left to work much or little, and to take the consequent
plenitude or hunger. When, therefore, under this sharp
but natural spur, a prisoner begins to exert himself, he
does so by his own will. The process which leads him into
habits of labour, is a process by which his self-control is
strengthened; and this is what is wanted to make him a
better citizen. It is to no purpose that you make him work
by external coercion; for when he is again free, and the
coercion absent, he will be what he was before. The
coercion must be an internal one, which he shall carry
with him out of prison. It avails little that you force
him to work; he must force himself to work. And this
he will do, only when placed in those conditions which
equity dictates.</p>

<p>Here, then, we find a third order of evidences. Psychology
supports our conclusion. The various experiments
above detailed, carried out by men who had no political
or ethical theories to propagate, have established facts
which we find to be quite concordant, not only with the
deductions of absolute morality, but also with the deductions
of mental science. Such a combination of different kinds
of proof, cannot, we think, be resisted.</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now let us try whether, by pursuing somewhat
further the method thus far followed, we can see our way
to the development of certain improved systems which are
coming into use.</p>

<p>Equity requires that the restraint of the criminal shall
be as great as is needful for the safety of society; but not
greater. In respect to the <i>quality</i> of the restraint, there is
little difficulty in interpreting this requirement; but there
is considerable difficulty in deciding on the <i>duration</i> of the
restraint. No obvious mode presents itself of finding out
how long a transgressor must be held in legal bondage, to
insure society against further injury from him. A longer
period than is necessary, implies an
actual injustice to <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
the offender. A shorter period than is necessary, implies
a potential injustice to society. And yet, without good
guidance, one or other of these extremes is almost sure to
be fallen into.</p>

<p>At present, the lengths of penal sentences are fixed in a
manner that is wholly empirical. For offences defined in
certain technical ways, Acts of Parliament assign transportations
and imprisonments, having durations not greater
than so much nor less than so much: these partially-determined
periods being arbitrarily fixed by legislators, under
the promptings of moral feeling. Within the assigned
limits the judge exercises his discretion; and in deciding
on the time over which the restraint shall extend, he is
swayed, partly by the special quality of the offence, partly
by the circumstances under which it was committed, partly
by the prisoner’s appearance and behaviour, partly by the
character given to him. And the conclusion he arrives at
after consideration of these data, depends very much on
his individual nature—his moral bias and his theories of
human conduct. Thus the mode of fixing the lengths of
penal restraints, is from beginning to end, little else than
guessing. How ill this system of guessing works, we have
abundant proofs. “Justices’ justice,” which illustrates it
in its simplest form, has become a bye-word; and the
decisions of higher criminal court frequently err in the
directions of both undue severity and undue lenity. Daily
there occur cases of extremely-trifling transgressions visited
with imprisonments of considerable lengths; and daily there
occur cases in which the punishments are so inadequate, that
the offenders time after time commit new crimes, when
time after time discharged from custody.</p>

<p>Now the question is whether, in place of this purely empirical
method which answers so ill, equity can guide us to
a method which shall more correctly adjust the period of
restraint to the requirement. We believe it can. We
believe that by following out its dictates,
we shall arrive <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
at a method that is in great measure self-acting; and
therefore less liable to be vitiated by errors of individual
judgment or feeling.</p>

<p>We have seen that were the injunctions of absolute
morality obeyed, every transgressor would be compelled to
make restitution or compensation. Throughout a considerable
range of cases, this would itself involve a period of
restraint varying in proportion to the magnitude of the
offence. It is true that when the malefactor possessed
ample means, the making restitution or compensation would
usually be to him but a slight punishment. But though in
these comparatively few cases, the regulation would fall
short of its object, in so far as its effect on the criminal was
concerned, yet in the immense majority of cases—in all
cases of aggressions committed by the poorer members
of the community—it would act with efficiency. It would
involve periods of detention that would be longer or
shorter according as the injury done was greater or less,
and according as the transgressor was idle or industrious.
And although between the injury done by an offender and
his moral turpitude, there is no constant and exact proportion,
yet the greatness of the injury done, affords, on the
average of cases, a better measure of the discipline required,
than do the votes of Parliamentary majorities and the
guesses of judges.</p>

<p>But our guidance does not end here. An endeavour still
further to do that which is strictly equitable, will carry us
still nearer to a correct adjustment of discipline to delinquency.
When, having enforced restitution, we insist on
some adequate guarantee that society shall not again be
injured, and accept any guarantee that is sufficient, we
open the way to a self-acting regulator of the period of detention.
Already our laws are in many cases satisfied with
securities for future good behaviour. Already this system
manifestly tends to separate the more vicious from the less
vicious; seeing that, on the average,
the difficulty of <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span>
finding securities is great in proportion as the character is bad.
And what we propose is that this system, now confined to
particular kinds of offences, shall be made general. But
let us be more specific.</p>

<p>A prisoner on his trial calls witnesses to testify to his
previous character—that is, if his character has been tolerably
good. The evidence thus given weighs more or less
in his favour, according to the respectability of the witnesses,
their number, and the nature of their testimony. Taking
into account these several elements, the judge forms his
conception of the delinquent’s general disposition, and
modifies the length of punishment accordingly. Now, may
we not fairly say that if the current opinion respecting a
convict’s character could be brought <i>directly</i> to bear in
qualifying the statutory sentence, instead of being brought
<i>indirectly</i> to bear, as at present, it would be a great improvement?
Clearly the estimate made by a judge from
such testimony, must be less accurate than the estimate
made by the prisoner’s neighbours and employers. Clearly,
too, the opinion expressed by such neighbours and employers
in the witness-box, is less trustworthy than an
opinion which entails on them serious responsibility. <i>The
desideratum is, that a prisoner’s sentence shall be qualified by
the judgment of those who have had life-long experience of
him; and that the sincerity of this judgment shall be tested
by their readiness to act on it.</i></p>

<p>But how is this to be done? A very simple method of
doing it has been suggested.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn8" id="fnanch8">8</a>
When a convict has fulfilled
his task of making restitution or compensation, let it
be possible for one or other of those who have known him, to
take him out of confinement, on giving adequate bail for his
good behaviour. Always premising that such an arrangement
shall be possible only under an official permit, to be
withheld if the prisoner’s conduct has been unsatisfactory;
and always premising that the person who
offers bail shall <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
be of good character and means; let it be competent for
such a one to liberate a prisoner by being bound on his
behalf for a specific sum, or by undertaking to make good
any injury which he may do to his fellow-citizens within a
specified period. This will doubtless be thought a startling
proposal. We shall, however, find good reasons to believe
it might be safely acted on—nay, we shall find facts proving
the success of a plan that is obviously less safe.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch8" id="fn8">8</a>
We owe the suggestion to the late Mr.
Octavius H. Smith.</p></div>

<p>Under such an arrangement, the liberator and the convict
would usually stand in the relation of employer and employed.
Those to be thus conditionally released, would be
ready to work for somewhat lower wages than were usual in
their occupation; and those who became bound for them,
besides having this economy of wages as an incentive,
would be in a manner guaranteed by it against the risk
undertaken. In working for less money, and in being
under the surveillance of his master, the convict would still
be undergoing a mitigated discipline. And while, on the
one hand, he would be put on his good behaviour by the
consciousness that his master might at any time cancel the
contract and surrender him back to the authorities, he
would, on the other hand, have a remedy against his master’s
harshness, in the option of returning to prison, and there
maintaining himself for the remainder of his term.</p>

<p>Observe, next, that the difficulty of obtaining such conditional
release would vary with the gravity of the offence
which had been committed. Men guilty of heinous crimes
would remain in prison; for none would dare to become
responsible for their good behaviour. Any one convicted a
second time would remain unbailed for a much longer period
than before; seeing that having once inflicted loss on some
one bound for him, he would not again be so soon offered
the opportunity of doing the like: only after a long period of
good behaviour testified to by prison-officers, would he be
likely to get another chance. Conversely, those whose transgressions
were not serious, and who
had usually been <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
well-conducted, would readily obtain recognizances; while to
venial offenders this qualified liberation would come as soon
as they had made restitution. Moreover, when innocent
persons had been pronounced guilty, as well as when solitary
misdeeds had been committed by those of really superior
natures, the system we have described would supply a
remedy. From the wrong verdicts of the law and its mistaken
estimates of turpitude, there would be an appeal;
and long-proved worth would bring its reward in the
mitigation of grievous injustices.</p>

<p>A further advantage would by implication result, in the
shape of a long industrial discipline for those who most
needed it. Speaking generally, diligent and skilful workmen,
who were on the whole useful members of society,
would, if their offences were not serious, soon obtain employers
to give bail for them. Whereas members of the
criminal class—the idle and the dissolute—would remain
long in confinement; since, until they had been brought by
habitual self-maintenance under restraint, to something like
industrial efficiency, employers would not be tempted to
become responsible for them.</p>

<p>We should thus have a self-acting test, not only of the
length of restraint required for social safety, but also of that
apprenticeship to labour which many convicts need; while
there would be supplied a means of rectifying sundry failures
and excesses of our present system. The plan would practically
amount to an extension of trial by jury. At present,
the State calls in certain of a prisoner’s fellow-citizens to
decide whether he is guilty or not guilty: the judge, under
guidance of the penal laws, being left to decide what punishment
he deserves, if guilty. Under the arrangement we
have described, the judge’s decision would admit of modification
by a jury of the convict’s neighbours. And this
natural jury, while it would be best fitted by previous
knowledge of the man to form an opinion, would be rendered
cautious by the sense of grave
responsibility; inasmuch as <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
any one of its number who gave a conditional release, would
do so at his own peril.</p>

<p>And now mark that all the evidence forthcoming to
prove the safety and advantages of the “intermediate
system,” proves, still more conclusively, the safety and
advantages of this system which we would substitute for
it. What we have described, is nothing more than an
intermediate system reduced to a natural instead of an
artificial form—carried out with natural checks instead of
artificial checks. If, as Captain Crofton has experimentally
shown, it is safe to give a prisoner conditional liberation,
on the strength of good conduct during a certain period of
prison-discipline; it is evidently safer to let his conditional
liberation depend not alone on good conduct while under
the eyes of his jailors, but also on the character he had
earned during his previous life. If it is safe to act on the
judgments of officials whose experience of a convict’s
behaviour is comparatively limited, and who do not suffer
penalties when their judgments are mistaken; then, manifestly,
it is safer (when such officials can show no reason
to the contrary), to act on the additional judgment of one
who has not only had better opportunities of knowing the
convict, but who will be a serious loser if his judgment
proves erroneous. Further, that surveillance over each
conditionally-liberated prisoner, which the “intermediate
system” exercises, would be still better exercised when,
instead of going to a strange master in a strange district,
the prisoner went to some master in his own district; and,
under such circumstances, it would be easier to get information
respecting his after-career. There is every reason
to think that this method would be workable. If, on the
recommendation of the officers, Captain Crofton’s prisoners
obtain employers “who have on many occasions returned
for others, in consequence of the good conduct of those at
first engaged;” still better would be the action of the
system when, instead of the
employers having “every <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
facility placed at their disposal for satisfying themselves as
to the antecedents of the convict,” they were already familiar
with his antecedents.</p>

<p>Finally, let us not overlook the fact, that this course is
the only one which, while duly consulting social safety, is
also entirely just to the prisoner. As we have shown, the
restraints imposed on a criminal are warranted by absolute
equity, only to the extent needful to prevent further
aggressions on his fellow-men; and when his fellow-men
impose greater restraints than these, they trespass against
him. Hence, when a prisoner has worked out his task of
making restitution, and, so far as is possible, undone the
wrong he had done, society is, in strict justice, bound to
accept any arrangement which adequately protects its
members against further injury. And if, moved by the
expectation of profit, or other motive, any citizen sufficiently
substantial and trustworthy, will take on himself to hold
society harmless, society must agree to his proposal. All
it can rightly require is, that the guarantee against contingent
injury <i>shall</i> be adequate; which, of course, it never
can be where the contingent injury is of the gravest kind.
No bail could compensate for murder; and therefore against
this, and other extreme crimes, society would rightly refuse
any such guarantee, even if offered, which it would be very
unlikely to be.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Such, then, is our code of prison-ethics. Such is the
ideal which we ought to keep ever in view when modifying
our penal system. Again we say, as we said at the outset,
that the realization of such an ideal wholly depends on the
advance of civilization. Let no one carry away the impression
that we regard all these purely equitable regulations
as immediately practicable. Though they may be partially
carried out, we think it highly improbable that they could
at present be carried out in full. The number of offenders,
the low average of enlightenment,
the ill-working of <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span>
administrative machinery, and above all, the difficulty of obtaining
officials of adequate intelligence, good feeling, and self-control,
are obstacles which must long stand in the way of
a system so complex as that which morality dictates. And
we here assert, as emphatically as before, that the harshest
penal system is ethically justified if it is as good as the
circumstances of the time permit. However great the
cruelties it inflicts, yet if a system theoretically more
equitable would not be a sufficient terror to evil-doers, or
could not be worked, from lack of officers sufficiently
judicious, honest, and humane—if less rigorous methods
would entail a diminution of social security; then the
methods in use are extrinsically good though intrinsically
bad. They are, as before said, the least wrong, and therefore
relatively right.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we have endeavoured to prove, it is
immensely important that, while duly considering the relatively
right, we should keep the absolutely right constantly
in view. True as it is that, in this transition state, our
conceptions of the ultimately expedient must ever be
qualified by our experience of the proximately expedient;
it is not the less true that the proximately expedient cannot
be determined unless the ultimately expedient is known.
Before we can say what is as good as the time permits, we
must say what is abstractedly good; for the first idea
involves the last. We must have some fixed standard,
some invariable measure, some constant clue; otherwise we
shall inevitably be misled by the suggestions of immediate
policy, and wander away from the right rather than advance
towards it. This conclusion is fully borne out by the facts
we have cited. In other cases, as well as in the case of penal
discipline, the evidence shows how terribly we have erred
from obstinately refusing to consult first principles and
clinging to an unreasoning empiricism. Though, during
civilization, grievous evils have occasionally arisen from
attempts suddenly to realize absolute
rectitude, yet a <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
greater sum total of evils has arisen from the more usual
course of ignoring absolute rectitude. Age after age, effete
institutions have been maintained far longer than they
would else have been, and equitable arrangements have
been needlessly postponed. Is it not time for us to profit
by past lessons?</p>

<p class="padtopb"><span class="smcap">P<b>OSTSCRIPT</b>.</span>—Since the publication of this essay in 1860
further evidence supporting its conclusions has been made
public. Dr. F.J. Mouat, late Inspector-General of Gaols in
Lower Bengal, has given, in various pamphlets and articles,
dating from 1872, accounts of his experiences, which
entirely harmonize with the foregoing general argument.
Speaking of three leading systems of prison-discipline,
“based on opposite theories,” he says:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“The oldest is, that a prison should be rendered a terror to evil doers by
the infliction of as much pain as can be inflicted, without direct injury to
health or risk to life. The second plan is a graduated system of punishment,
from which the direct infliction of pain is eliminated, and the prisoner is
allowed to work his way to freedom and mitigation of sentence, by mere
good conduct in jail. The third, and in my humble judgment the best, is
to convert every prison into a school of industry, labour being used as an
instrument of punishment, discipline, and reformation.”—<i>Prison Industry in
its Primitive, Reformatory, and Economic Aspects</i>
(London, Nov. 1889).</p></blockquote>

<p>In his pamphlet on the <i>Prison System of India</i>, published
in 1872, Dr. Mouat contends:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“That remunerative prison labour is an efficient instrument of punishment
and reformation by occupying the whole available time of criminals in
uncongenial and compulsory employments; by teaching them the means of
gaining an honest livelihood on release; by the inculcation of habits of
order and industry, to the displacement of the irregularity and idleness
which are the sources of so much vice and crime; and by repaying to the
State the whole or part of the cost of repression of crime by the compulsory
industry of the unproductive classes, and thus relieving the community at
large from a burden which it is at present compelled to bear.</p>

<p>“That the economic objections to the remunerative employment of convicts
are unsound and untenable; and that even if they were true as respects
individuals and small sections of the community, the interests of the
minority should yield to the general welfare.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Once more, under the title <i>Prison Discipline and its
Results in Bengal</i>, first published in the
<i>Journal of the <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
Society of Arts</i> in 1872, Dr. Mouat, after describing an
exhibition of gaol-manufactures held in Calcutta in 1856,
urges “that every prisoner sentenced to labour should be
made to repay to the State the whole cost of his punishment
in gaol; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that prisons should be made, as
much as possible, schools of industry, as combining, more
completely than can be effected by any other system, the
punishment of the offender, with the protection of society.”
He then goes on to show what have been the results of
the self-supporting system:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“The net profits realized from the labour of the convicts actually employed
in handicrafts, after deducting the cost of production, were, in round numbers,
as follows:―</p>

<p class="pcontinue">In all, nearly half a million of
money. In 1866, the accounts were made
up for only eight months, to introduce the calendar in place of the official
year, which ended on the 30th of April.</p>

<p>“If the limits of time and space permitted, I could show you in minute
detail that each skilled prisoner employed in handicrafts, striking the
average of all the jails, earned considerably more than he cost; that five of
the prisons under my charge were at various times self-supporting, and
that one of them, the great industrial prison at Alipore, a suburb of
Calcutta, has repaid very considerably more than its cost, for the last ten
years continuously.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As Dr. Mouat held the position of Inspector-General of
Gaols in Lower Bengal for 15 years, and as, during that
period, he had under his control an average of 20,000
prisoners, it may, I think, be held that his experiences
have been tolerably extensive, and that a system justified
by such experiences is worthy of adoption. Unfortunately,
however, men pooh-pooh those experiences which do not
accord with their foregone conclusions.</p>

<p>I have occasionally vented the paradox
that mankind go <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
right only when they have tried all possible ways of going
wrong: intending it to be taken with some qualification.
Of late, however, I have observed that in some respects
this paradox falls short of the truth. Sundry instances
have shown me that even when mankind have at length
stumbled into the right course, they often deliberately return
to the wrong.</p>

<h2 class="h2nobreak">THE ETHICS OF KANT.</h2></div>

<div class="dchappre">
<p class="pfirst">[<i>From the</i> Fortnightly
Review <i>for July 1888. This essay was
called forth by attacks on me made in essays published in
preceding numbers of the</i> Fortnightly Review—<i>essays in which
the Kantian system of ethics was lauded as immensely superior to
the system of ethics defended by me. The last section now appears
for the first time.</i>]</p></div>

<p>If, before Kant uttered that often-quoted saying in
which, with the stars of Heaven he coupled the conscience
of Man, as being the two things that excited his awe, he
had known more of Man than he did, he would probably
have expressed himself somewhat otherwise. Not, indeed,
that the conscience of Man is not wonderful enough, whatever
be its supposed genesis; but the wonderfulness of it
is of a different kind according as we assume it to have
been supernaturally given or infer that it has been naturally
evolved. The knowledge of Man in that large sense
which Anthropology expresses, had made, in Kant’s day,
but small advances. The books of travel were relatively
few, and the facts which they contained concerning the
human mind as existing in different races, had not been
gathered together and generalized. In our days the
conscience of Man, as inductively known, has none of that
universality of presence and unity of nature, which Kant’s
saying tacitly assumes. Sir John Lubbock writes:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“In fact, I believe that the lower races of men may be said
to be deficient <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
in the idea of right. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That there should be any races of men so
deficient in moral feeling, was altogether opposed to the preconceived ideas
with which I commenced the study of savage life, and I have arrived at the
conviction by slow degrees, and even with reluctance.”—<i>Origin of Civilization</i>,
1882, pp. 404–5.</p></blockquote>

<p>But now let us look at the evidence from which this
impression is derived, as we find it in the testimonies of
travellers and missionaries.</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>Praising his deceased son, Tui Thakau, a Fijian Chief, concluded “by
speaking of his daring spirit and consummate cruelty, as he could kill his
own wives if they offended him, and eat them afterwards.”—<i>Western Pacific.</i>
J. E. Erskine, p. 248.</p>

<p>“Shedding of blood is to him no crime, but a glory .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be somehow
an acknowledged murderer is the object of the Fijian’s restless ambition.”—<i>Fiji
and the Fijians.</i> Rev. T. Williams, i., p. 112.</p>

<p>“It is a melancholy fact that when they [the Zulu boys] have arrived at a
very early age, should their mothers attempt to chastise them, such is the
law, that these lads are at the moment allowed to kill their mothers.”—<i>Travels
and Adventures in Southern Africa.</i> G. Thompson, ii., p. 418.</p>

<p>“Murther, adultery, thievery, and all other such like crimes, are here
[Gold Coast] accounted no sins.”—<i>Description of the Coast of Guinea.</i> W.
Bosman, p. 130.</p>

<p>“The accusing conscience is unknown to him [the East African]. His
only fear after committing a treacherous murder is that of being haunted by
the angry ghost of the dead.”—<i>Lake Regions of Central Africa.</i> R. F.
Burton, ii., p. 336.</p>

<p>“I never could make them [East Africans] understand the existence of
good principle.”—<i>The Albert N’Yanza.</i> S. W. Baker, i., pp. 241.</p>

<p>“The Damaras kill useless and worn-out people; even sons smother
their sick fathers.”—<i>Narrative of an Explorer in Tropical South Africa.</i>
F. Galton, p. 112.</p>

<p>The Damaras “seem to have no perceptible notion of right and wrong.”—<i>Ibid.</i>
p. 72.</p></blockquote>

<p>Against these we may set some converse facts. At the
other extreme we have a few Eastern tribes—pagans they
are called—who practise the virtues which Western nations—Christians
they are called—do but teach. While Europeans
thirst for blood-revenge in much the same way as
the lowest savages, there are some simple peoples of the
Indian Hills, as the Lepchas, who “are singularly forgiving
of injuries;”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn9" id="fnanch9">9</a>
and Campbell exemplifies “the
effect of a <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
very strong sense of duty on this savage.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn10" id="fnanch10">10</a>
That character
which the creed of Christendom is supposed to foster
is exhibited in high degree by the Arafuras (Papuans) who
live in “peace and brotherly love with one another”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn11" id="fnanch11">11</a>
to
such extent that government is but nominal. And concerning
various of the Indian Hill-tribes, as the Santáls,
Sowrahs, Marias, Lepchas, Bodo and Dhimáls, different
observers testify of them severally that “they were the
most truthful set of men I ever met,”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn12" id="fnanch12">12</a>
“crime and criminal
officers are almost unknown,”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn13" id="fnanch13">13</a>
“a pleasing feature in
their character is their complete truthfulness,”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn14" id="fnanch14">14</a>
“they
bear a singular character for truthfulness and honesty,”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn15" id="fnanch15">15</a>
they are “wonderfully honest,”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn16" id="fnanch16">16</a>
“honest and truthful in
deed and word.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn17" id="fnanch17">17</a>
Irrespective of race, we find these
traits in men who are, and have long been, absolutely
peaceful (the uniform antecedent), be they the Jakuns of
the South Malayan Peninsula, who “are never known to
steal anything, not even the most insignificant trifle,”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn18" id="fnanch18">18</a>
or
be it in the Hos of the Himalaya, among whom “a reflection
on a man’s honesty or veracity may be sufficient to send
him to self-destruction.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn19" id="fnanch19">19</a>
So that in respect of conscience
these uncivilized people are as superior to average Europeans,
as average Europeans are superior to the brutal
savages previously described.</p>

<p>Had Kant had these and kindred
facts before him, <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
his conception of the human mind, and consequently his
ethical conception, would scarcely have been what they
were. Believing, as he did, that one object of his awe—the
stellar Universe—has been evolved, he might by evidence
like the foregoing have been led to suspect that the
other object of his awe—the human conscience—has been
evolved, and has consequently a real nature unlike its
apparent nature.</p>

<p class="padtopb">For the disciples of Kant living in our day there can be
made no such defence as that which may be made for their
master. On all sides of them lie classes of facts of various
kinds, which might suffice to make them hesitate, if nothing
more. Here are a few such classes of facts.</p>

<p>Though, unlike the uncultured, who suppose everything
to be what it appears, chemists had for many generations
known that multitudinous substances which seem simple
are really compound, and often highly compound; yet,
until the time of Sir Humphrey Davy, even chemists had
believed that certain substances which resisted all their
powers of decomposition, were to be classed among the
elements. Davy, however, by subjecting the alkalies to
a force not before applied, proved that they are oxides
of metals; and, suspecting the like to be the case with
the earths, similarly proved the composite nature of these
also. Not only the common sense of the uncultured, but
the common sense of the cultured was shown to be wrong.
Wider knowledge has, as usual, led to greater modesty,
and, since Davy’s day, chemists have felt less certain that
the so-called elements are elementary. Contrariwise, increasing
evidence of sundry kinds leads them to suspect
more and more strongly that they are all compound.</p>

<p>Alike to the labourer who digs it out and to the carpenter
who uses it in his workshop, a piece of chalk appears a
thing than which nothing can be simpler; and ninety-nine
people out of a hundred would agree with
them. Yet a <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
piece of chalk is highly complex. A microscope shows it
to consist of myriads of shells of <i>Foraminifera</i>; shows,
further, that it contains more kinds than one; and shows,
further still, that each minute shell, whole or broken, is
formed of many chambers, every one of which once contained
a living unit. Thus by ordinary inspection, however close,
the true nature of chalk cannot be known; and to one who
has absolute confidence in his eyes the assertion of its true
nature appears absurd.</p>

<p>Take again a living body of a seemingly uncomplicated
kind—say a potato. Cut it through and observe how
structureless is its substance. But though unaided vision
gives this verdict, aided vision gives a widely different one.
Aided vision discovers, in the first place, that the mass is
everywhere permeated by vessels of complex formation.
Further, that it is made up of innumerable units called
cells, each of which has walls composed of several layers.
Further still, that each cell contains a number of starch-grains.
And yet still further, that each of these grains is
formed of layer within layer, like the coats of an onion.
So that where there appears perfect simplicity there is really
complexity within complexity.</p>

<p>From these examples which the objective world furnishes,
let us turn to some examples furnished by the subjective
world—some of our states of consciousness. Up to modern
times any one who, looking out on the snow, was told that
the impression of whiteness it gave him was composed of
impressions such as those given by the rainbow, would have
regarded his informant as a lunatic; as would even now
the great mass of mankind. But since Newton’s day, it
has become well known to a relatively small number that
this is literal fact. Not only may white light be resolved
by a prism into a number of brilliant colours, but, by an
appropriate arrangement, these colours can be re-combined
into white light: the visual sensation which seems perfectly
simple proves to be highly
compound. Those who <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
habitually suppose that things are what they seem, are wrong
here as in multitudinous other cases.</p>

<p>Another example is supplied by the sensation of sound.
A solitary note struck on the piano, or a blast from a horn,
yields through the ear a feeling which appears homogeneous;
and the uninstructed are incredulous if told that it is an
intricate combination of noises. In the first place, that which
constitutes the more voluminous part of the tone is accompanied
by a number of over-tones, producing what is known
as its <i>timbre</i>: instead of one note, there are half a dozen
notes, of which the chief has its character specialized by
the others. In the second place, each of these notes, consisting
objectively of a rapid series of aërial waves, produces
subjectively a rapid series of impressions on the auditory
nerve. Either by the appliance of Hooke or by Savart’s
machine or by the siren, it is proved to demonstration that
every musical sound is the product of successive units of
sound, each in itself unmusical, which, as they succeed one
another with increasing rapidity, produce a tone which progressively
rises in pitch. Here again, then, under an
apparent simplicity there is a double complexity.</p>

<p>Most of these examples of the illusiveness of unaided
perception, whether exercised upon objective or subjective
existences, were unknown to Kant. Had they been known
to him they might have suggested other views concerning
certain of our states of consciousness, and might have given
a different character to his philosophy. Let us observe
what would possibly have been the changes in two of his
cardinal conceptions—metaphysical and ethical.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Our consciousness of Time and Space appeared to him,
as they appear to everyone, perfectly simple; and the
apparent simplicity he accepted as actual simplicity. Had
he suspected that, just as the seemingly homogeneous and
undecomposable consciousness of Sound really consists of
multitudinous units of consciousness,
so might the <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
apparently homogeneous and undecomposable consciousness of
Space, he would possibly have been led to inquire whether
the consciousness of Space is not wholly composed of infinitely
numerous relations of position, such as those which
every portion of it presents. And finding that every portion
of Space, immense or minute, cannot be either known
or conceived save in some relative position to the conscious
subject, and that, besides involving the relations of distance
and direction, it invariably contains within itself relations
of right and left, top and bottom, nearer and farther; he
might perhaps have concluded that our consciousness of
that matrix of phenomena we call Space, has been built up
in the course of Evolution by accumulated experiences
registered in the nervous system. And had he concluded
this, he would not have committed himself to the many
absurdities which his doctrine involves.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn20" id="fnanch20">20</a></p>

<p>Similarly, if, instead of assuming that conscience is simple
because it seems simple to ordinary introspection, he had
entertained the hypothesis that it is perhaps complex—a
consolidated product of multitudinous experiences received,
mainly by ancestors and added to by self—he might have
arrived at a consistent system of Ethics. That the habitual
association of pains with certain things and acts, generation
after generation, may produce organic repugnance to such
things and acts,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn21" id="fnanch21">21</a>
might, had it been known to him, have
made him suspect that conscience is a product of Evolution.
And in that case his conception of it would not have
been incongruous with the facts above named, showing
that there are widely different degrees of conscience in
different races.</p>

and § 520.</p></div>

<p>In brief, as already implied, had Kant, instead of his
incongruous beliefs that the celestial bodies have had an
evolutionary origin, but that the minds of living beings on
them, or at least on one of them,
have had a <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
non-evolutionary origin, entertained the belief that both have arisen
by Evolution, he would have been saved from the impossibilities
of his Metaphysics, and the untenabilities of his
Ethics. To the consideration of these last, let us now pass.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Before doing this, however, something must be
said concerning abnormal reasoning as compared with
normal reasoning.</p>

<p>Knowledge which is of the highest order in respect of
certainty, and which we call exact science, is distinguished
from other knowledge by its definitely quantitative previsions.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn22" id="fnanch22">22</a>
It sets out with data, and proceeds by steps
which, taken together, enable it to say under what specified
conditions a specified relation of phenomena will be found;
and to say in what place, or at what time, or in what
quantity, or all of them, a certain effect will be witnessed.
Given the factors of any arithmetical operation, and there
is absolute certainty in the result reached, supposing there
are no stumblings: stumblings which always admit of
detection and disproof by the method which we shall
presently find is pursued. Base and angles having been
accurately measured, that sub-division of geometry which
is called trigonometry yields with certainty the distance or
the height of the object of which the position is sought.
The ratio of the arms of a lever having been stated,
mechanics tells us what weight at one end will balance an
assigned weight at the other. And by the aid of these
three exact sciences, the Calculus, Geometry, and Mechanics,
Astronomy can predict to the minute, for each separate
place on the Earth, when an eclipse will begin and end,
and how near it will approach to totality. Knowledge of
this order has infinite justifications in the successful guidance
of infinitely numerous human actions. The accounts
of every trader, the operations of every workshop, the
navigation of every vessel, depend
for their trustworthiness <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
on these sciences. The method they pursue, therefore,
verified in cases which pass all human power to enumerate,
is a method not to be transcended in certainty.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch22" id="fn22">22</a>
See Essay on “Genesis of Science.”</p></div>

<p>What is this method? Whichever of these sciences we
examine, we find the course uniformly pursued to be that
of setting out with propositions of which the negations are
inconceivable, and advancing by successive dependent
propositions, each of which has the like character—that its
negation is inconceivable. In a developed consciousness
(and of course I exclude minds of which the faculties are
unformed) it is impossible to represent things that are
equal to the same thing as being themselves unequal; and
in a developed consciousness, action and re-action cannot be
thought of as other than equal and opposite. In like
manner, every <i>because</i> and every <i>therefore</i>, used in a mathematical
argument, connotes a proposition of which the
terms are absolutely coherent in the mode alleged: the
proof being that an attempt to bring together in consciousness
the terms of the opposite proposition is futile. And
this method of testing, alike the fundamental propositions
and all members of the fabrics of propositions raised upon
them, is consistently pursued in verifying the conclusion.
Inference and observation are compared; and when they
agree, it is held inconceivable that the inference is other
than true.</p>

<p>In contrast to the method which I have just described,
distinguishable as the legitimate <i>a priori</i> method, there is
one which may be called—I was about to say, the illegitimate
<i>a priori</i> method. But the word is not strong enough;
it must be called the inverted <i>a priori</i> method. Instead of
setting out with a proposition of which the negation is
inconceivable, it sets out with a proposition of which the
affirmation is inconceivable, and therefrom proceeds to draw
conclusions. It is not consistent, however: it does not
continue to do that which it does at first. Having posited
an inconceivable proposition to begin with,
it does not <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
frame its argument out of a series of inconceivable
propositions. All steps after the first are of the kind
ordinarily accepted as valid. The successive <i>therefores</i> and
<i>becauses</i> have the usual connotations. The peculiarity lies
in this, that in every proposition save the first, the reader
is expected to admit the logical necessity of an inference
drawn, for the reason that the opposite is not thinkable;
but he is not supposed to expect a like conformity to
logical necessity in the primary proposition. The dictum
of a logical consciousness which must be recognized as
valid in every subsequent step, must be ignored in the first
step. We pass now to an illustration of this method which
here concerns us.</p>

<p>The first sentence in Kant’s first chapter runs thus:—“Nothing
can possibly be conceived in the world, or even
out of it, which can be called good without qualification,
except a Good Will.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn23" id="fnanch23">23</a>
And then on the next page we
come upon the following definition:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“A good will is good not because of what it performs or
effects, nor by its aptness for the attainment of some
proposed end, but simply by virtue of the volition, that
is, it is good in itself, and considered by itself is to
be esteemed much higher than all that can be brought about
by it in favour of any inclination, nay even of the sum
total of all inclinations.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn24"
id="fnanch24">24</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">Most
fallacies result from the habit of using words without
fully rendering them into thoughts—passing them by with
recognitions of their meanings as ordinarily used, without
stopping to consider whether these meanings admit of
being given to them in the cases named. Let us not rest
satisfied with thinking vaguely of what is understood by
“a Good Will,” but let us interpret the words definitely.
Will implies the consciousness of some end. Exclude from
it every idea of purpose and the conception of Will disappears.
An end of some kind being necessarily implied by
the conception of Will, the quality of the
Will is determined <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
by the quality of the end contemplated. Will itself, considered
apart from any distinguishing epithet, is not
cognizable by Morality at all. It becomes cognizable by
Morality only when it gains its character as good or bad by
virtue of its contemplated end as good or bad. If any one
doubts this, let him try whether he can think of a good
will which contemplates a bad end. The whole question,
therefore, centres in the meaning of the word good. Let
us look at the meanings habitually given to it.</p>

<p>We speak of good meat, good bread, good wine; by
which phrases we mean either things that are palatable,
and so give pleasure, or things that are wholesome, and by
conducing to health conduce to pleasure. A good fire,
good clothing, a good house, we so name because they
minister either to comfort, which means pleasure, or gratify
the æsthetic sentiment, which also means pleasure. So it
is with things which more indirectly further welfare, as
good tools or good roads. When we speak of a good workman,
a good teacher, a good doctor, it is the same:
efficiency in aiding others’ well-being is what we indirectly
mean. Yet again, good government, good institutions,
good laws, connote benefits yielded to the society in which
they exist: benefits being equivalent to certain kinds of
happiness, positive or negative. But Kant tells us that a
good will is one that is good in and for itself without reference
to ends. We are not to think of it as prompting acts
which will profit the man himself, either by conducing to
his health, advancing his culture, or improving his inclinations;
for all these are in the long run conducive to
happiness, and are urged only for the reason that they do
this. We are not to think of a will as good because, by
fulfilment of it, friends are saved from sufferings or have
their gratifications increased; for this would involve
calling it good because of beneficial ends in view. Nor
must conduciveness to social ameliorations, present or
future, be taken into account when we
attempt to conceive <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
a good will. In short, we are to frame our idea of a good
will without any material out of which to frame the idea of
good: good is to be used in thought as an eviscerated term.</p>

<p>Here, then, is illustrated what I have called above the
inverted <i>a priori</i> method of philosophizing: the setting out
with an inconceivable proposition. The Kantian Metaphysics
starts by asserting that Space is “nothing but” a
form of intuition—pertains wholly to the subject and not at
all to the object. This is a verbally intelligible proposition,
but one of which the terms cannot be put together in
consciousness; for neither Kant, nor any one else, ever
succeeded in bringing into unity of representation the
thought of Space and the thought of Self, as being the one
an attribute of the other. And here we see that, just in
the same way, the Kantian Ethics begins by positing
something which seems to have a meaning but which has
really no meaning—something which, under the conditions
imposed, cannot be rendered into thought at all. For
neither Kant, nor any one else, ever has or ever can, frame
a consciousness of a good will when from the word good are
expelled all thoughts of those ends which we distinguish
by the word good.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Evidently Kant himself sees that his assumption invites
attack, for he proceeds to defend it. He says:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“There is, however, something so strange in this idea of the absolute
value of the mere will, in which no account is taken of its utility, that
notwithstanding the thorough assent of even common reason to the idea [!],
yet a suspicion must arise that it may perhaps really be the product of mere
high-flown fancy, &amp;c.” (p. 13).</p></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">And
then to prepare for a justification, he goes on to say:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“In the physical constitution of an organized being we assume it as a
fundamental principle that no organ for any purpose will be found in it but
what is also the fittest and best adapted for that purpose” (pp. 13–14).</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, even had this assumption been valid, the argument
he bases upon it, far-fetched as it is, might be considered
of very inadequate strength to warrant the supposition that
there can be a will conceived as good
without any reference <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
to good ends. But, unfortunately for Kant, the assumption
is utterly invalid. In his day it probably passed without
question; but in our day few if any biologists would admit
it. On the special-creation hypothesis some defence of
the proposition might be attempted, but the evolution-hypothesis
tacitly negatives it entirely. Let us begin with
some minor facts which militate against Kant’s supposition.
Take, first, rudimentary organs. These are numerous
throughout the animal kingdom. While representing
organs which were of use in ancestral types, they are of
no use in the types possessing them; and, as being
rudimentary, they are of necessity imperfect. Moreover,
besides being injurious by taxing nutrition to no purpose,
they are almost certainly in some cases injurious by being
in the way. Then, beyond the argument from rudimentary
organs, there is the argument from make-shift organs,
which form a large class. We have a conspicuous case in
the swimming organ of the seal, formed by the apposition
of the two hind limbs—an organ manifestly inferior to one
specially shaped for its function, and one which, during
early stages of the changes which have produced it, must
have been very inefficient. But the untruth of the assumption
is best shown by comparing a given organ in a low
type of creature with the same organ in a high type. The
alimentary canal, for example, in very inferior creatures is
a simple tube, substantially alike from end to end, and
having throughout all its parts the same function. But in
a superior creature this tube is differentiated into mouth,
æsophagus, stomach (or stomachs), small and large intestines
with their various appended glands pouring in
secretions. Now if this last form of alimentary canal is to
be regarded as a perfect organ, or something like it, what
shall we say of the original form; and what shall we say of
all those forms lying between the two? The vascular system,
again, furnishes a clear instance. The primitive heart is
nothing but a dilatation of the great
blood vessel—a pulsatile <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
sac. But a mammal has a four-chambered heart with valves,
by the aid of which the blood is propelled through the lungs
for aëration, and throughout the system at large for general
purposes. If this four-chambered heart is a perfect organ,
what is the primitive heart, and what are the hearts possessed
by all the multitudinous creatures below the higher <i>vertebrata</i>?
Manifestly the process of evolution implies a continual
replacing of creatures having inferior organs, by creatures
having superior organs; leaving such of the inferior as can
survive to occupy inferior spheres of life. This is not only
so throughout the whole animal creation up to Man himself,
but it is so within the limits of the human race. Both the
brains and the lower limbs of various inferior races are
ineffective organs, compared with those of superior races.
Nay, even in the highest type of Man we have obvious
imperfections. The structure of the groin is imperfect: the
frequent ruptures which result from it would have been
prevented by closure of the inguinal rings during fœtal life
after they had performed their office. That all-important
organ the vertebral column, too, is as yet but incompletely
adapted to the upright posture. Only while the vigour is
considerable can there be maintained, without appreciable
effort, those muscular contractions which produce the sigmoid
flexure, and bring the lumbar portion into such a
position that the “line of direction” falls within it. In
young children, in boys and girls who are admonished to
“sit up,” in weakly people, and in the old, the spine lapses
into that convex form characteristic of lower <i>Primates</i>. It
is the same with the balancing of the head. Only by a
muscular strain to which habit makes us insensible, as it
does to the exposure of the face to cold, is the head maintained
in position. Immediately certain cervical muscles
are relaxed the head falls forward; and where there is
great debility the chin rests permanently on the chest.</p>

<p>So far, indeed, is the assumption of Kant from being
true that the very reverse is
probably true. After <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
contemplating the countless examples of imperfections exhibited
in low types of creatures, and decreasing with the ascent
to high types, but still exemplified in the highest, anyone
who concludes, as he may reasonably do, that Evolution
has not yet reached its limit, must infer that most likely
no such thing as a perfect organ exists. Thus the basis
of the argument by which Kant attempts to justify his
assumption that there exists a good will apart from a good
end, disappears utterly; and leaves his dogma in all its
naked unthinkableness.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn25" id="fnanch25">25</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch25" id="fn25">25</a>
I find that in the above three paragraphs I have done Kant less than
justice and more than justice—less, in assuming that his evolutionary view
was limited to the genesis of our sidereal system, and more, in assuming that
he had not contradicted himself. My knowledge of Kant’s writings is
extremely limited. In 1844 a translation of his <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>
(then I think lately published) fell into my hands, and I read the first few
pages enunciating his doctrine of Time and Space: my peremptory rejection
of which caused me to lay the book down. Twice since then the same thing
has happened; for, being an impatient reader, when I disagree with the
cardinal propositions of a work I can go no further. One other thing I knew.
By indirect references I was made aware that Kant had propounded the idea
that celestial bodies have been formed by the aggregation of diffused matter.
Beyond this my knowledge of his conceptions did not extend; and my
supposition that his evolutionary conception had stopped short with the
genesis of sun, stars, and planets, was due to the fact that his doctrine of
Time and Space, as forms of thought anteceding experience, implied a
supernatural origin inconsistent with the hypothesis of natural genesis. Dr.
Paul Carus, who, shortly after the publication of this article in the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i> for July, 1888, undertook to defend the Kantian ethics in the
American journal which he edits, <i>The Open Court</i>, has now (Sept. 4, 1890),
in another defensive article, translated sundry passages from Kant’s
<i>Critique of Judgment</i>, his <i>Presumable Origin of Humanity</i>, and his work
<i>Upon the different Races of Mankind</i>, showing that Kant was, if not fully,
yet partially, an evolutionist in his speculations about living beings. There
is, perhaps, some reason for doubting the correctness of Dr. Carus’s rendering
of these passages into English. When, as in the first of the articles just
named, he failed to distinguish between consciousness and con­scien­tious­ness,
and when, as in this last article, he blames the English for mistranslating
Kant, since they have said “Kant maintained that Space and Time are
intuitions,” which is quite untrue, for they have
everywhere described him
as maintaining that Space and Time are <i>forms</i> of intuition, one may be
excused for thinking that possibly Dr. Carus has read into some of Kant’s
expressions, meanings which they do not rightly bear. Still, the general
drift of the passages quoted makes it tolerably clear that Kant must have
believed in the operation of natural causes as largely, though not entirely,
instrumental in producing organic forms: extending this belief (which he
says “can be named a daring venture of reason”) in some measure to the
origin of Man himself. He does not, however, extend the theory of natural
genesis to the exclusion of the theory of supernatural genesis. When he speaks
of an organic habit “which in the wisdom of nature appears to be thus
arranged in order that the species shall be preserved;” and when, further,
he says “we see, moreover, that a germ of reason is placed in him, whereby,
after the development of the same, he is destined for social intercourse,” he
implies divine intervention. And this shows that I was justified in ascribing
to him the belief that Space and Time, as forms of thought, are supernatural
endowments. Had he conceived of organic evolution in a consistent manner,
he would necessarily have regarded Space and Time as subjective forms
generated by converse with objective realities.</p>

<p>Beyond showing that Kant had a partial, if not a complete, belief in
organic evolution (though with no idea of its causes), the passages translated
by Dr. Carus show that he entertained an implied belief which it here
specially concerns me to notice as bearing on his theory of “a good will.”
He quotes approvingly Dr. Moscati’s lecture showing “that the upright walk
of man is constrained and unnatural,” and showing the imperfect visceral
arrangements and consequent diseases which result: not only adopting, but
further illustrating, Dr. Moscati’s argument. If here, then, there is a distinct
admission, or rather assertion, that various human organs are imperfectly
adjusted to their functions, what becomes of the postulate above quoted
“that no organ for any purpose will be found in it but what is also the
fittest and best adapted for that purpose?” And what becomes of the
argument which sets out with this postulate? Clearly, I am indebted to
Dr. Carus for enabling me to prove that Kant’s defence of his theory of “a
good will” is, by his own showing, baseless.</p></div>

<p class="padtopb">One of the propositions contained in Kant’s
first chapter <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
is that “we find that the more a cultivated reason applies
itself with deliberate purpose to the enjoyment of life and
happiness, so much the more does the man fail of true
satisfaction.” A preliminary remark to be made on this
statement is that in its sweeping form it is not true. I
assert that it is untrue on the strength of personal experiences.
In the course of my life there have occurred
many intervals, averaging more than a month each, in
which the pursuit of happiness was the sole
object, and in <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
which happiness was successfully pursued. How successfully,
may be judged from the fact that I would gladly live
over again each of those periods without change—an
assertion which I certainly cannot make of any portions of
my life spent in the daily discharge of duties. That which
Kant should have said is that the <i>exclusive</i> pursuit of what
are distinguished as pleasures and amusements, is disappointing.
This is doubtless true; and for the obvious
reason that it over-exercises one group of faculties and
exhausts them, while it leaves unexercised another group
of faculties, which consequently do not yield the gratifications
ac­com­pa­ny­ing their exercise. It is not, as Kant says,
guidance by “a cultivated reason” which leads to disappointment,
but guidance by an uncultivated reason; for a
cultivated reason teaches that continuous action of a small
part of the nature joined with inaction of the rest, must
end in dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>But now, supposing we accept Kant’s statement in full,
what is its implication? That happiness is the thing to be
desired, and, in one way or another, the thing to be achieved.
For if not, what meaning is there in the statement that it
will not be achieved when made the immediate object?
One who was thus admonished might properly rejoin:—“You
say I shall fail to get happiness if I make it the
object of pursuit? Suppose then I do not make it the
object of my pursuit; shall I get it? If I do, then your
admonition amounts to this, that I shall obtain it better if I
proceed in some other way than that I adopt. If I do not
get it, then I remain without happiness if I follow your
way, just as much as if I follow my own, and nothing is
gained.” An illustration will best show how the matter
stands. To a tyro in archery the instructor says:—“Sir,
you must not point your arrow directly at the target. If
you do, you will inevitably miss it. You must aim high
above the target; and you may then possibly pierce the
bull’s eye.” What now is implied by the
warning and the <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
advice? Clearly that the purpose is to hit the target.
Otherwise there is no sense in the remark that it will be
missed if directly aimed at; and no sense in the remark
that to be hit, something higher must be aimed at.
Similarly with happiness. There is no sense in the remark
that happiness will not be found if it is directly sought,
unless happiness is a thing to be somehow or other obtained.</p>

<p>“Yes; there is sense,” I hear it said. “Just as it may
be that the target is not the thing to be hit at all, either
by aiming directly or indirectly at it, but that some other
thing is to be hit; so it may be that the thing to be
achieved immediately or remotely is not happiness at all, but
some other thing: the other thing being duty.” In answer
to this the admonished man may reasonably say:—“What
then is meant by Kant’s statement that the man who
pursues happiness ‘fails of true satisfaction’? All happiness
is made up of satisfactions. The ‘true satisfaction’
which Kant offers as an alternative, must be some kind of
happiness; and if a truer satisfaction, must be a better
happiness; and better must mean on the average, and in
the long run, greater. If this ‘true satisfaction’ does not
mean greater happiness of self,—distant if not proximate,
in another life if not in this life—and if it does not mean
greater happiness by achieving the happiness of others;
then you propose to me as an end a smaller happiness
instead of a greater, and I decline it.”</p>

<p>So that in this professed repudiation of happiness as an
end, there lies the inavoidable implication that it <i>is</i> the end.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The last consideration introduces us naturally to another
of Kant’s cardinal doctrines. That there may be no
mistake in my representation of it, I must make a
long quotation.</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“I omit here all actions which are already recognized as inconsistent with
duty, although they may be useful for this or that purpose, for with these the
question whether they are done <i>from duty</i> cannot arise at all, since they
even conflict with it. I also set aside those actions
which really conform to <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span>
duty, but to which men have <i>no</i> direct <i>inclination</i>, performing them because
they are impelled thereto by some other inclination. For in this case we
can readily distinguish whether the action which agrees with duty is done
<i>from duty</i>, or from a selfish view. It is much harder to make this
distinction when the action accords with duty, and the subject has besides
a <i>direct</i> inclination to it. For example, it is always a matter of duty that a
dealer should not overcharge an inexperienced purchaser, and wherever
there is much commerce the prudent tradesman does not overcharge, but
keeps a fixed price for every one, so that a child buys of him as well as any
other. Men are thus <i>honestly</i> served; but this is not enough to make us
believe that the tradesman has so acted from duty and from principles of
honesty: his own advantage required it; it is out of the question in this
case to suppose that he might besides have a direct inclination in favour of
the buyers, so that, as it were, from love he should give no advantage to
one over another [!]. Accordingly the action was done neither from duty
nor from direct inclination, but merely with a selfish view. On the other
hand, it is a duty to maintain one’s life; and, in addition, every one has
also a direct inclination to do so. But on this account the often anxious
care which most men take for it has no intrinsic worth, and their maxim
has no moral import. They preserve their life <i>as duty requires</i>, no doubt,
but not <i>because duty requires</i>. On the other hand, if adversity and hopeless
sorrow have completely taken away the relish for life; if the unfortunate
one, strong in mind, indignant at his fate rather than desponding or dejected,
wishes for death, and yet preserves his life without loving it—not from
inclination or fear, but from duty—then his maxim has a moral worth.</p>

<p>“To be beneficent when we can is a duty; and besides this, there are
many minds so sympathetically constituted that without any other motive
of vanity or self-interest, they find a pleasure in spreading joy around them,
and can take delight in the satisfaction of others so far as it is their own
work. But I maintain that in such a case an action of this kind, however
proper, however amiable it may be, has nevertheless no true moral worth,
but is on a level with other inclinations” (pp. 17–19).</p></blockquote>

<p>I have given this extract at length that there may be
fully understood the remarkable doctrine it embodies—a
doctrine especially remarkable as exemplified in the last
sentence. Let us now consider all that it means.</p>

<p>Before doing this, however, I may remark that, space
permitting, it might be shown clearly enough that the
assumed distinction between <i>sense</i> of duty and inclination
is untenable. The very expression sense of duty implies
that the mental state signified is a feeling; and if a feeling
it must, like other feelings, be gratified by acts of one kind
and offended by acts of an opposite kind. If
we take the <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
name conscience, which is equivalent to sense of duty, we
see the same thing. The common expressions “a tender
conscience” “a seared conscience,” indicate the perception
that conscience is a feeling—a feeling which has its
satisfactions and dissatisfactions, and which <i>inclines</i> a man
to acts which yield the one and avoid the other—produces
an <i>inclination</i>. The truth is that conscience, or the sense
of duty, is an inclination of a complex kind as distinguished
from inclinations of simpler kinds.</p>

<p>But let us grant Kant’s distinction in an unqualified
form. Doing this, let us entertain, too, his proposition
that acts of whatever kind done from inclination have no
moral worth, and that the only acts having moral worth
are those done from a sense of duty. To test this proposition
let us follow an example he sets. As he would have
the quality of an act judged by supposing it universalized,
let us judge of moral worth as he conceives it by making
a like supposition. That we may do this effectually, let us
assume that it is exemplified not only by every man but by
all the acts of every man. Unless Kant alleges that a man
may be morally worthy in too high a degree, we must
admit that the greater the number of his acts which have
moral worth the better. Let us then contemplate him as
doing nothing from inclination but everything from a
sense of duty.</p>

<p>When he pays the labourer who has done a week’s work
for him, it is not because letting a man go without wages
would be against his inclination, but solely because he sees
it to be a duty to fulfil contracts. Such care as he takes
of his aged mother is prompted not by tender feeling for
her but by the consciousness of filial obligation. When he
gives evidence on behalf of a man whom he knows to have
been falsely charged, it is not that he would be hurt by
seeing the man wrongly punished, but simply in pursuance
of a moral intuition showing him that public duty requires
him to testify. When he sees a little child
in danger of <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
being run over, and steps aside to snatch, it away, he does
so not because thought of the impending death of the
child pains him, but because he knows it is a duty to save
life. And so throughout, in all his relations as husband,
as friend, as citizen, he thinks always of what the law of
right conduct directs, and does it because it is the law of
right conduct, not because he satisfies his affections or his
sympathies by doing it. This is not all however. Kant’s
doctrine commits him to something far beyond this. If
those acts only have moral worth which are done from a
sense of duty, we must not only say that the moral worth
of a man is greater in proportion as the number of the acts
so done is greater. We must also say that his moral worth
is greater in proportion as his sense of duty makes him do
the right thing not only apart from inclination but against
inclination. According to Kant, then, the most moral man
is the man whose sense of duty is so strong that he refrains
from picking a pocket though he is much tempted to do it;
who says of another that which is true though he would
like to injure him by a falsehood; who lends money to his
brother though he would prefer to see him in distress; who
fetches the doctor to his sick child though death would
remove what he feels to be a burden. What, now, shall we
think of a world peopled with Kant’s typically moral men—men
who, in the one case, while doing right by one another,
do it with indifference, and severally know one another to
be so doing it; and men who, in the other case, do right by
one another notwithstanding the promptings of evil passions
to do otherwise, and who severally know themselves surrounded
by others similarly prompted? Most people will,
I think, say that even in the first case life would be hardly
bearable, and that in the second case it would be absolutely
intolerable. Had such been men’s natures, Schopenhauer
would indeed have had good reason for urging that the
race should bring itself to an end as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Contemplate now the doings of one
whose acts, according <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
to Kant, have no moral worth. He goes through his daily
work not thinking of duty to wife and child, but having in
his mind the pleasure of witnessing their welfare; and on
reaching home he delights to see his little girl with rosy
cheeks and laughing eyes eating heartily. When he hands
back to a shopkeeper the shilling given in excess of right
change, he does not stop to ask what the moral law requires:
the thought of profiting by the man’s mistake is intrinsically
repugnant to him. One who is drowning he plunges in to
rescue without any idea of obligation, but because he cannot
contemplate without horror the death which threatens. If,
for a worthy man who is out of employment, he takes much
trouble to find a place, he does it because the consciousness
of the man’s difficulties is painful to him, and because he
knows that he will benefit not only him but the employer
who engages him: no moral maxim enters his mind. When
he goes to see a sick friend the gentle tones of his voice and
the kindly expression of his face show that he is come not
from any sense of duty, but because pity and a desire to
raise his friend’s spirits have moved him. If he aids in
some public measure which helps men to help themselves,
it is not in pursuance of the admonition “Do as you would
be done by,” but because the distresses around make him
unhappy, and the thought of mitigating them gives him
pleasure. And so throughout: he ever does the right thing
not in obedience to any injunction but because he loves the
right thing in and for itself. And now who would not like
to live in a world where everyone was thus characterized?</p>

<p>What, then, shall we think of Kant’s conception of moral
worth, when, if it were displayed universally in men’s acts
the world would be intolerable, and when if these same acts
were universally performed from inclination, the world
would be delightful?</p>

<p class="padtopb">But now, from these indirect criticisms, let us
pass to a <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
direct criticism of the Kantian principle—the principle often
quoted as distinctive of his ethics. He states it thus:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“There is therefore but one categorical imperative, namely this: <i>Act only
on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become
a universal law</i>.” (pp. 54–5.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, subsequently, we read:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“<i>Act on maxims which can at the same time have for their object themselves
as universal laws of nature.</i> Such then is the formula of an absolutely good
will.” (p. 80.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, then, we have a clear statement of that which
constitutes the character of a good will; which good will,
as we have already seen, is said to exist independently of
any contemplated end. Let us now observe how this
theory is reduced to practice. Speaking of a man who is
absolutely selfish and yet absolutely just, he represents
him as saying:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“Let everyone be as happy as heaven pleases or as he can make himself;
I will take nothing from him nor even envy him, only I do not wish to contribute
anything either to his welfare or to his assistance in distress! Now no
doubt if such a mode of thinking were a universal law, the human race
might very well subsist, and doubtless even better than in a state in which
every one talks of sympathy and good will, or even takes care occasionally
to put it into practice, but on the other side, also cheats when he can, betrays
the rights of men or otherwise violates them. But although it is possible
that a universal law of nature might exist in accordance with that maxim,
it is impossible to <i>will</i> that such a principle should have the universal
validity of a law of nature. For a will which resolved this would contradict
itself, inasmuch as many cases might occur in which one would have need
of the love and sympathy of others, and in which by such a law of nature,
sprung from his own will, he would deprive himself of all hope of the aid he
desires.” (pp. 58–9.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we see illustrated the guidance of conduct in conformity
with the Kantian maxim; and what is the process
of guidance? It is that of considering what, in the particular
case, would be the result if the suggested course of
conduct were made universal; and then being deterred from
willing such conduct by the badness of the conceived result.
Now, in the first place, what here becomes of the doctrine
of a good will, which we are told
exists “without paying <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
any regard to the effect expected from it”? (p. 24). The
good will, characterized by readiness to see the act it
prompts made universal, has, in this particular case, as in
every other case, to be decided by contemplation of an
end—if not a special and immediate end then a general and
remote end. And what, in this case, is to be the deterrent
from a suggested course of conduct? Consciousness that
the result, if such conduct were universal, might be suffering
to self: there might be no aid when it was wanted. So
that, in the first place, the question is to be decided by the
contemplation of happiness or misery as likely to be caused
by the one or the other course; and, in the second place,
this happiness or misery is that of the individual himself.
Strangely enough, this principle which is lauded because
of its apparently implied altruism, turns out, in the last
resort, to have its justification in egoism!</p>

<p>The essential truth here to be noted, however, is that the
Kantian principle, so much vaunted as higher than that of
expediency or utilitarianism, is compelled to take expediency
or utilitarianism as its basis. Do what it will, it
cannot escape the need for conceiving happiness or misery,
to self or others or both, as respectively to be achieved or
avoided; for in any case what, except the conceived happiness
or misery which would follow if a given mode of
action were made universal, can determine the will for or
against such mode of action? If, in one who has been
injured, there arises a temptation to murder the injurer;
and if, following out the Kantian injunction, the tempted
man thinks of himself as willing that all men who have
been injured should murder those who have injured them;
and if, imagining the consequences experienced by mankind
at large, and possibly on some occasion by himself in
particular, he is deterred from yielding to the temptation;
what is it which deters him? Obviously the representation
of the many evils, pains, deprivations of happiness,
which would be caused. If, on imagining his
act to be <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
universalized, he saw that it would increase human happiness,
the alleged deterrent would not act. Hence the conduct
to be insured by adoption of the Kantian maxim is
simply the conduct to be insured by making the happiness
of self or others or both the end to be achieved. By implication,
if not avowedly, the Kantian principle is as distinctly
utilitarian as the principle of Bentham. And it falls short
of a scientific ethics in just the same way; since it fails to
furnish any method by which to determine whether such
and such acts <i>would</i> or <i>would not</i> be conducive to happiness—leaves
all such questions to be decided empirically.</p>

<p>Life in Fiji, at the time when Thomas Williams settled
there, must have been something worse than uncomfortable.
One of the people who passed near the string of nine
hundred stones with which Ra Undreundre recorded the
number of human victims he had devoured, must have had
unpleasant waking thoughts and occasionally horrible
dreams. A man who had lost some fingers for breaches of
ceremony, or had seen his neighbour killed by a chief for
behaviour not sufficiently respectful, and who remembered
how King Tanoa cut off his cousin’s arm, cooked it and ate
it in his presence, and then had him hacked to pieces, must
not unfrequently have had “a bad quarter of an hour.”
Nor could creeping sensations have failed to run through
women who heard Tui Thakau eulogizing his dead son for
cruelty, and saying that “he could kill his own wives if
they offended him, and eat
them afterwards.” Happiness <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
could not have been general in a society where there was a
liability to be one among the ten whose life-blood baptized
the decks of a new canoe—a society in which the killing
even of unoffending persons was no crime but a glory;
and in which everyone knew that his neighbour’s restless
ambition was to be an acknowledged murderer. Still,
there must have been some moderation in murdering even
in Fiji. Or must we hesitate to conclude that unlimited
murder would have caused extinction of the society?</p>

<p>The extent to which each man’s possessions among the
Biluchis are endangered by the predatory instincts of his
neighbours, may be judged from the fact that “a small
mud tower is erected in each field, where the possessor
and his retainers guard his produce.” If turbulent states
of society such as early histories tell of, do not show us so
vividly how the habit of appropriating one another’s goods
interferes with social prosperity and individual comfort,
yet they do not leave us in doubt respecting these results.
It is an inference which few will be hardy enough to
dispute, that in proportion as the time of each man, instead
of being occupied in further production, is occupied in
guarding that which he has produced against marauders,
the total production must be diminished and the sustentation
of each and all less satisfactorily achieved. And it
is a manifest corollary that if each pushes beyond a certain
limit the practice of trying to satisfy his needs by robbing
his neighbour, the society must dissolve: solitary life will
prove preferable.</p>

<p>A deceased friend of mine, narrating incidents in his life,
told me that as a young man he sought to establish himself
in Spain as a commission agent; and that, failing by
expostulation or other means to obtain payment from one
who had ordered goods through him, he, as a last resource,
went to the man’s house and presented himself before him
pistol in hand—a proceeding which had the desired effect:
the account was settled. Suppose
now that everywhere <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
contracts had thus to be enforced by more or less strenuous
measures. Suppose that a coal-mine proprietor in Derbyshire,
having sent a train-load to a London coal-merchant,
had commonly to send a <i>posse</i> of colliers up to town, to
stop the man’s wagons and take out the horses until
payment had been made. Suppose the farm-labourer or
the artisan was constantly in doubt whether, at the end of
the week, the wages agreed upon would be forthcoming;
or whether he would get only half, or whether he would
have to wait six months. Suppose that daily in every shop
there occurred scuffles between shopman and customer,
the one to get the money without giving the goods, and the
other to get the goods without paying the money. What in
such case would happen to the society? What would become
of its producing and distributing businesses? Is it a rash
inference that industrial co-operation (of the voluntary
kind at least) would cease?</p>

<p>“Why these absurd questions?” asks the impatient
reader. “Surely everyone knows that murder, assault,
robbery, fraud, breach of contract, &amp;c., are at variance
with social welfare and must be punished when committed,”
My replies are several. In the first place, I am quite
content to have the questions called absurd; because this
implies a consciousness that the answers are so self-evident
that it is absurd to assume the possibility of any other
answers. My second reply is that I am not desirous of
pressing the question <i>whether</i> we know these things, but of
pressing the question <i>how</i> we know these things. Can we
know them, and do we know them, by contemplating
the necessities of the case? or must we have recourse to
“inductions based on careful observation and experience”?
Before we make and enforce laws against murder, ought we
to inquire into the social welfare and individual happiness
in places where murder prevails, and observe whether or
not the welfare and happiness are greater in places where
murder is rare? Shall robbery be allowed to
go on until, <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
by collecting and tabulating the effects in countries where
thieves predominate and in countries where thieves are
but few, we are shown by induction that prosperity is
greater when each man is allowed to retain that which
he has earned? And is it needful to prove by accumulated
evidence that breaches of contract impede production
and exchange, and those benefits to each and all which mutual
dependence achieves? In the third place, these instances of
actions which, pushed to extremes, cause social dissolution,
and which, in smaller degrees, hinder social co-operation
and its benefits, I give for the purpose of asking what is
their common trait. In each of such actions we see aggression—a
carrying on of life in a way which directly interferes
with the carrying on of another’s life. The relation
between effort and consequent benefit in one man, is either
destroyed altogether or partially broken by the doings of
another man. If it be admitted that life can be maintained
only by certain activities (the internal ones being universal,
and the external ones being universal for all but parasites
and the immature), it must be admitted that when like-natured
beings are associated, the required activities must
be mutually limited; and that the highest life can result
only when the associated beings are so constituted as
severally to keep within the implied limits. The restrictions
stated thus generally, may obviously be developed
into special restrictions referring to this or that kind of
conduct. These, then, I hold are <i>a priori</i> truths which admit
of being known by contemplation of the conditions—axiomatic
truths which bear to ethics a relation analogous
to that which the mathematical axioms bear to the
exact sciences.</p>

<p>I do not mean that these axiomatic truths are cognisable
by all. For the apprehension of them, as for the apprehension
of simpler axioms, a certain mental growth and a
certain mental discipline are needed. In the <i>Treatise on
Natural Philosophy</i> by Professors Thomson
and Tait [1st ed.], <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
it is remarked that “physical axioms are axiomatic to
those only who have sufficient knowledge of the action of
physical causes to enable them to see at once their necessary
truth.” Doubtless a fact and a significant fact. A plough-boy
cannot form a conception of the axiom that action and
reaction are equal and opposite. In the first place he lacks
a sufficiently generalized idea of action—has not united
into one conception pushing and pulling, the blow of a fist,
the recoil of a gun, and the attraction of a planet. Still
less has he any generalized idea of reaction. And even had
he these two ideas, it is probable that, defective in power
of representation as he is, he would fail to recognize the
necessary equality. Similarly with these <i>a priori</i> ethical
truths. If a member of that Fijian slave-tribe who regarded
themselves as food for the chiefs had suggested that there
might arrive a time when men would not eat one another,
his implied belief that men might come to have a little
respect for one another’s lives, condemned as utterly without
justification in experience, would be considered as fit only
for a wild speculator. Facts furnished by every-day
observation make it clear to the Biluchi, keeping watch in
his mud-tower, that possession of property can be maintained
only by force; and it is most likely to him scarcely
conceivable that there exist limits which, if mutually
recognized, may exclude aggressions, and make it needless
to mount guard over fields: only an absurd idealist (supposing
such a thing known to him) would suggest the
possibility. And so even of our own ancestors in feudal
times, it may be concluded that, constantly going about
armed and often taking refuge in strongholds, the thought
of a peaceful social state would have seemed ridiculous;
and the belief that there might be a recognized equality
among men’s claims to pursue the objects of life, and a
consequent desistence from aggressions, would have been
scarcely conceivable. But now that an orderly social state
has been maintained for generations—now
that in daily <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span>
intercourse men rarely use violence, commonly pay what
they owe, and in most cases respect the claims of the weak
as well as those of the strong—now that they are brought
up with the idea that all men are equal before the law, and
daily see judicial decisions turning upon the question
whether one citizen has or has not infringed upon the equal
rights of another; there exist in the general mind materials
for forming the conception of a <i>régime</i> in which men’s
activities are mutually limited, and in which maintenance
of harmony depends on respect for the limits. There has
arisen an ability to see that mutual limitations are required
when lives are carried on in proximity; and to see that
there necessarily emerge definite sets of restraints applying
to definite classes of actions. And it has become
manifest to some, though not it seems to many, that there
results an <i>a priori</i> system of absolute political ethics—a
system under which men of like natures, severally so
constituted as spontaneously to refrain from trespassing,
may work together without friction, and with the greatest
advantage to each and all.</p>

<p>“But men are not wholly like-natured and are unlikely
to become so. Nor are they so constituted that each is
solicitous for his neighbour’s claims as for his own, and
there is small probability that they ever will be. Your
absolute political ethics is therefore an ideal beyond the
reach of the real.” This is true. Nevertheless, much as it
seems to do so, it does not follow that there is no use for
absolute political ethics. The contrary may clearly enough
be shown. An analogy will explain the paradox.</p>

<p>There exists a division of physical science distinguished as
abstract mechanics or absolute mechanics—absolute in the
sense that its propositions are unqualified. It is concerned
with statics and dynamics in their pure forms—deals with
forces and motions considered as free from all interferences
resulting from friction, resistances of media, and special
properties of matter. If it enunciates a law
of motion, it <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
recognizes nothing which modifies manifestation of it.
If it formulates the properties of the lever it treats of this
assuming it to be perfectly rigid and without thickness—an
impossible lever. Its theory of the screw imagines
the screw to be frictionless; and in treating of the
wedge, absolute incompressibility is supposed. Thus
its truths are never presented in experience. Even those
movements of the heavenly bodies which are deducible
from its propositions are always more or less perturbed; and
on the Earth the inferences to be drawn from them deviate
very considerably from the results reached by experiment.
Nevertheless this system of ideal mechanics is indispensable
for the guidance of real mechanics. The engineer has to
deal with its propositions as true in full, before he proceeds
to qualify them by taking into account the natures of the
materials he uses. The course which a projectile would
take if subject only to the propulsive force and the attraction
of the Earth must be recognized, though no such course is
ever pursued: correction for atmospheric resistance cannot
else be made. That is to say, though, by empirical methods,
applied or relative mechanics may be developed to a considerable
extent, it cannot be highly developed without the
aid of absolute mechanics. So is it here. Relative political
ethics, or that which deals with right and wrong in public
affairs as partially determined by changing circumstances,
cannot progress without taking into account right and
wrong considered apart from changing circumstances—cannot
do without absolute political ethics; the propositions
of which, deduced from the conditions under which life is
carried on in an associated state, take no account of the
special circumstances of any particular associated state.</p>

<p>And now observe a truth which seems entirely overlooked;
namely, that the set of deductions thus arrived at
is verified by an immeasurably vast induction, or rather by
a great assemblage of vast inductions. For what else are
the laws and judicial systems of all civilized
nations, and of <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span>
all societies which have risen above savagery? What is
the meaning of the fact that all peoples have discovered
the need for punishing murder, usually by death? How is
it that where any considerable progress has been made,
theft is forbidden by law, and a penalty attached to it?
Why along with further advance does the enforcing of
contracts become general? And what is the reason that
among fully civilized peoples frauds, libels, and minor
aggressions of various kinds are repressed in more or less
rigorous ways? No cause can be assigned save a general
uniformity in men’s experiences, showing them that aggressions
directly injurious to the individuals aggressed
upon are indirectly injurious to society. Generation after
generation observations have forced this truth on them;
and generation after generation they have been developing
the interdicts into greater detail. That is to say, the above
fundamental principle and its corollaries arrived at <i>a priori</i>
are verified in an infinity of cases <i>a posteriori</i>. Everywhere
the tendency has been to carry further in practice
the dictates of theory—to conform systems of law to the
requirements of absolute political ethics: if not consciously,
still unconsciously. Nay, indeed, is not this truth manifest
in the very name used for the end aimed at—equity or
equalness? Equalness of what? No answer can be given
without a recognition—vague it may be, but still a recognition—of
the doctrine above set forth.</p>

<p>Thus, instead of being described as putting faith in
“long chains of deduction from abstract ethical assumptions”
I ought to be described as putting faith in simple
deductions from abstract ethical necessities; which deductions
are verified by infinitely numerous observations and
experiences of semi-civilized and civilized mankind in all
ages and places. Or rather I ought to be described as one
who, contemplating the restraints everywhere put on the
various kinds of transgressions, and seeing in them all a
common principle everywhere dictated
by the necessities <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
of the associated state, proceeds to develop the consequences
of this common principle by deduction, and to justify both
the deductions and the conclusions which legislators have
empirically reached by showing that the two correspond.
This method of deduction verified by induction
is the method of developed science at large. I do not
believe that I shall be led to abandon it and change my
“way of thinking” by any amount of disapproval, however
strongly expressed.</p>

<p>Are we then to understand that by this imposing title,
“Absolute Political Ethics,” nothing more is meant than
a theory of the needful restraints which law imposes on the
actions of citizens—an ethical warrant for systems of law?
Well, supposing even that I had to answer “Yes” to this
question (which I do not), there would still be an ample
justification for the title. Having for its subject-matter all
that is comprehended under the word “Justice,” alike as
formulated in law and administered by legal in­stru­men­tal­i­ties,
the title has a sufficiently large area to cover.
This would scarcely need saying were it not for a curious
defect of thought which we are everywhere led into by habit.</p>

<p>Just as, when talking of knowledge, we ignore entirely
that familiar knowledge of surrounding things, animate
and inanimate, acquired in childhood, in the absence of
which death would quickly result, and think only of that
far less essential knowledge gained at school and college or
from books and conversation—just as, when thinking of
mathematics, we include under the name only its higher
groups of truths and drop out that simpler group constituting
arithmetic, though for the carrying on of life
this is more important than all the rest put together;
so, when politics and political ethics are discussed, there
is no thought of those parts of them which include whatever
is fundamental and long settled. The word political
raises ideas of party-contests, ministerial changes, prospective
elections, or else of the
Home-Rule question, the <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
Land-Purchase scheme, Local Option, or the Eight-Hours
movement. Rarely does the word suggest law-reform, or
a better judicial organization, or a purified police. And
if ethics comes into consideration, it is in connexion with the
morals of parliamentary strife or of candidates’ professions,
or of electoral corruptions. Yet it needs but to look at
the definition of politics (“that part of ethics which consists
in the regulation and government of a nation or state, for
the preservation of its safety, peace, and prosperity”), to
see that the current conception fails by omitting the chief
part. It needs but to consider how relatively immense
a factor in the life of each man is constituted by safety of
person, security of house and property, and enforcement of
claims, to see that not only the largest part but the part
which is vital is left out. Hence the absurdity does not
exist in the conception of an absolute political ethics, but it
exists in the ignoring of its subject-matter. Unless it be
considered absurd to regard as absolute the interdicts
against murder, burglary, fraud and all other aggressions,
it cannot be considered absurd to regard as absolute the
ethical system which embodies these interdicts.</p>

<p>It remains to add that beyond the deductions which, as we
have seen, are verified by vast assemblages of inductions,
there may be drawn other deductions not thus verified—deductions
drawn from the same data, but which have no
relevant experiences to say yes or no to them. Such
deductions may be valid or invalid; and I believe that in
my first work, written forty years ago and long since withdrawn
from circulation, there are some invalid deductions.
But to reject a principle and a method because of some
invalid deductions, is about as proper as it would be to
pooh-pooh arithmetic because of blunders in certain arithmetical
calculations.</p>

<p class="padtopb">I turn now to a question above put—whether, by absolute
political ethics, nothing more is meant
than an ethical <span class="xxpn" id="p227">{227}</span>
warrant for systems of law—a question to which, by implication,
I answered No. And now I have to answer that it
extends over a further field equally wide if less important.
For beyond the relations among citizens taken individually,
there are the relations between the incorporated body of
citizens and each citizen. And on these relations between
the State and the man, absolute political ethics gives
judgments as well as on the relations between man and man.
Its judgments on the relations between man and man are
corollaries from its primary truth, that the activities of
each in pursuing the objects of life may be rightly
restricted only by the like activities of others: such others
being like-natured (for the principle does not contemplate
slave-societies or societies in which one race dominates
over another); and its judgments on the relations between
the man and the State are corollaries from the allied truth,
that the activities of each citizen may be rightly limited by
the incorporated body of citizens only as far as is needful
for securing to him the remainder. This further limitation
is a necessary accompaniment of the militant state; and
must continue so long as, besides the criminalities of
individual aggression, there continue the criminalities of
international aggression. It is clear that the preservation
of the society is an end which must take precedence of the
preservation of its individuals taken singly; since the
preservation of each individual and the maintenance of his
ability to pursue the objects of life, depend on the preservation
of the society. Such restrictions upon his actions as
are imposed by the necessities of war, and of preparedness
for war when it is probable, are therefore ethically defensible.</p>

<p>And here we enter upon the many and involved questions
with which relative political ethics has to deal. When
originally indicating the contrast, I spoke of “absolute
political ethics, or that which ought to be, as distinguished
from relative political ethics, or that which is at present
the nearest practicable approach to it;”
and had any <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
attention been paid to this distinction, no controversy need have
arisen. Here I have to add that the qualifications which
relative political ethics sets forth vary with the type of the
society, which is primarily determined by the extent to
which defence against other societies is needful. Where
international enmity is great and the social organization
has to be adapted to warlike activities, the coercion of
individuals by the State is such as almost to destroy their
freedom of action and make them slaves of the State; and
where this results from the necessities of defensive war (not
offensive war, however), relative political ethics furnishes a
warrant. Conversely, as militancy decreases, there is a
diminished need both for that subordination of individuals
which is necessitated by consolidating them into a fighting
machine, and for that further subordination entailed by
supplying this fighting machine with the necessaries of life;
and as fast as this change goes on, the warrant for State-coercion
which relative political ethics furnishes becomes
less and less.</p>

<p>Obviously it is out of the question here to enter upon the
complex questions raised. It must suffice to indicate them
as above. Should I be able to complete Part IV. of <i>The
Principles of Ethics</i>, treating of “Justice,” of which the
first chapters only are at present written, I hope to deal
adequately with these relations between the ethics of the
progressive condition and the ethics of that condition
which is the goal of progress—a goal ever to be recognized,
though it cannot be actually reached.</p>

<p>From time to time there returns on the cautious thinker,
the conclusion that, considered simply as a question of probabilities,
it is unlikely that his views upon any debatable
topic are correct. “Here,” he reflects, “are thousands
around me holding on this or that point opinions differing
from mine—wholly in many cases; partially in most others.
Each is as confident as I am of the truth of his convictions.
Many of them are possessed of great intelligence; and,
rank myself high as I may, I must admit that some are my
equals—perhaps my superiors. Yet, while every one of us
is sure he is right, unquestionably most of us are wrong.
Why should not I be among the mistaken? True, I
cannot realize the likelihood that I am so. But this proves
nothing; for though the majority of us are necessarily in
error, we all labour under the inability to think we are in
error. Is it not then foolish thus
to trust myself? When <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
I look back into the past, I find nations, sects, theologians,
philosophers, cherishing beliefs in science, morals, politics,
and religion, which we decisively reject. Yet they held
them with a faith quite as strong as ours: nay—stronger, if
their intolerance of dissent is any criterion. Of what little
worth, therefore, seems this strength of my conviction that
I am right! A like warrant has been felt by men all the
world through; and, in nine cases out of ten, has proved a
delusive warrant. Is it not then absurd in me to put so
much faith in my judgments?”</p>

Some of the illustrations used in this essay refer to laws and
arrangements changed since it was written; while many recent occurrences
might now be cited in further aid of its argument. As, however, the
reasoning is not affected by these changes; and as to keep it corrected to
the facts of the day would involve perpetual alterations; it seems best to
leave it substantially in its original state: or rather in the state in which it
was republished in Mr. Chapman’s <i>Library
for the People</i>.</p></div>

<p>Barren of practical results as this reflection at first sight
appears, it may, and indeed should, influence some of our
most important proceedings. Though in daily life we are
constantly obliged to act out our inferences, trustless as
they may be—though in the house, in the office, in the
street, there hourly arise occasions on which we may not
hesitate; seeing that if to act is dangerous, never to act at
all is fatal—and though, consequently, on our private
conduct, this abstract doubt as to the worth of our judgments,
must remain inoperative; yet, in our public conduct,
we may properly allow it to weigh. Here decision is no
longer imperative; while the difficulty of deciding aright
is incalculably greater. Clearly as we may think we see
how a given measure will work, we may infer, drawing
the above induction from human experience, that the
chances are many against the truth of our anticipations.
Whether in most cases it is not wiser to do nothing,
becomes now a rational question. Continuing his self-criticism,
the cautious thinker may reason:—“If in these
personal affairs, where all the conditions of the case were
known to me, I have so often miscalculated, how much
oftener shall I miscalculate in political affairs, where the
conditions are too numerous, too wide-spread, too complex,
too obscure to be understood. Here, doubtless, is a social
evil and there a desideratum; and were I sure of doing no
mischief I would forthwith try to cure the
one and achieve <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
the other. But when I remember how many of my private
schemes have miscarried—how speculations have failed,
agents proved dishonest, marriage been a disappointment—how
I did but pauperize the relative I sought to help—how
my carefully-governed son has turned out worse than most
children—how the thing I desperately strove against as a
misfortune did me immense good—how while the objects I
ardently pursued brought me little happiness when gained,
most of my pleasures have come from unexpected sources;
when I recall these and hosts of like facts, I am struck
with the incompetence of my intellect to prescribe for
society. And as the evil is one under which society has
not only lived but grown, while the desideratum is one it
may spontaneously obtain, as it has most others, in some
unforeseen way, I question the propriety of meddling.”</p>

<p class="padtopb">There is a great want of this practical humility in our
political conduct. Though we have less self-confidence
than our ancestors, who did not hesitate to organize in law
their judgments on all subjects whatever, we have yet far
too much. Though we have ceased to assume the infallibility
of our theological beliefs and so ceased to enact them,
we have not ceased to enact hosts of other beliefs of an
equally doubtful kind. Though we no longer presume to
coerce men for their <i>spiritual good</i>, we still think ourselves
called upon to coerce them for their <i>material good</i>: not
seeing that the one is as useless and as unwarrantable as
the other. Innumerable failures seem, so far, powerless to
teach this. Take up a daily paper and you will probably
find a leader exposing the corruption, negligence, or mismanagement
of some State-department. Cast your eye
down the next column, and it is not unlikely that you will
read proposals for an extension of State-supervision.
Yesterday came a charge of gross carelessness against the
Colonial office. To-day Admiralty bunglings are burlesqued.
To-morrow brings
the question—“Should there <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
not be more coal-mine inspectors?” Now there is a complaint
that the Board of Health is useless; and now an
outcry for more railway regulation. While your ears are
still ringing with denunciations of Chancery abuses, or
your cheeks still glowing with indignation at some well-exposed
iniquity of the Ecclesiastical Courts, you suddenly
come upon suggestions for organizing “a priesthood of
science.” Here is a vehement condemnation of the police
for stupidly allowing sight-seers to crush each other to
death. You look for the corollary that official regulation is
not to be trusted; when, instead, <i>à propos</i> of a shipwreck,
you read an urgent demand for government-inspectors to
see that ships always have their boats ready for launching.
Thus, while every day chronicles a failure, there every day
reappears the belief that it needs but an Act of Parliament
and a staff of officers, to effect any end desired. Nowhere
is the perennial faith of mankind better seen. Ever since
society existed Disappointment has been preaching—“Put
not your trust in legislation;” and yet the trust in legislation
seems scarcely diminished.</p>

<p>Did the State fulfil efficiently its unquestionable duties,
there would be some excuse for this eagerness to assign it
further duties. Were there no complaints of its faulty
ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice; of its endless delays and untold
expenses; of its bringing ruin in place of restitution; of its
playing the tyrant where it should have been the protector—did
we never hear of its complicated stupidities; its
20,000 statutes, which it assumes all Englishmen to know,
and which not one Englishman does know; its multiplied
forms, which, in the effort to meet every contingency, open
far more loopholes than they provide against—had it not
shown its folly in the system of making every petty alteration
by a new act, variously affecting innumerable preceding
acts; or in its score of successive sets of Chancery
rules, which so modify, and limit, and extend, and abolish,
and alter each other, that not even
Chancery lawyers know <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
what the rules are—were we never astounded by such a fact
as that, under the system of land registration in Ireland,
6000l. have been spent in a “negative search” to establish
the title of an estate—did we find in its doings no such
terrible incongruity as the imprisonment of a hungry
vagrant for stealing a turnip, while for the gigantic embezzlements
of a railway director it inflicts no punishment;—had
we, in short, proved its efficiency as judge and
defender, instead of having found it treacherous, cruel, and
anxiously to be shunned, there would be some encouragement
to hope other benefits at its hands.</p>

<p>Or if, while failing in its judicial functions, the State had
proved itself a capable agent in some other department—the
military for example—there would have been some
show of reason for extending its sphere of action. Suppose
that it had rationally equipped its troops, instead of giving
them cumbrous and ineffective muskets, barbarous grenadier
caps, absurdly heavy knapsacks and cartouche-boxes, and
clothing coloured so as admirably to help the enemy’s
marksmen—suppose that it organized well and economically,
instead of salarying an immense superfluity of officers, creating
sinecure colonelcies of 4000<i>l.</i> a year, neglecting the meritorious
and promoting incapables—suppose that its soldiers
were always well housed instead of being thrust into barracks
that invalid hundreds, as at Aden, or that fall on their
occupants, as at Loodianah, where ninety-five were thus
killed—suppose that, in actual war, it had shown due
administrative ability, instead of occasionally leaving its
regiments to march barefoot, to dress in patches, to capture
their own engineering tools, and to fight on empty stomachs,
as during the Peninsular campaign;—suppose all this,
and the wish for more State-control might still have had
some warrant.</p>

<p>Even though it had bungled in everything else, yet had
it in one case done well—had its naval management alone
been efficient—the sanguine would have
had a colourable <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
excuse for expecting success in a new field. Grant that
the reports about bad ships, ships that will not sail, ships
that have to be lengthened, ships with unfit engines, ships
that will not carry their guns, ships without stowage, and
ships that have to be broken up, are all untrue—assume
those to be mere slanderers who say that the <i>Megœra</i> took
double the time taken by a commercial steamer to reach the
Cape; that during the same voyage the <i>Hydra</i> was three times
on fire, and needed the pumps kept going day and night;
that the <i>Charlotte</i> troop-ship set out with 75 days’ provisions
on board, and was three months in reaching her destination;
that the <i>Harpy</i>, at an imminent risk of life, got home in
110 days from Rio—disregard as calumnies the statements
about septuagenarian admirals, dilettante ship building,
and “cooked” dockyard accounts—set down the affair of
the Goldner preserved meats as a myth, and consider Professor
Barlow mistaken when he reported of the Admiralty
compasses in store, that “at least one-half were mere
lumber;”—let all these, we say, be held groundless charges,
and there would remain for the advocates of much government
some basis for their political air-castles, spite of
military and judicial mismanagement.</p>

<p>As it is, however, they seem to have read backwards the
parable of the talents. Not to the agent of proved efficiency
do they consign further duties, but to the negligent and
blundering agent. Private enterprise has done much, and
done it well. Private enterprise has cleared, drained,
and fertilized the country, and built the towns—has
excavated mines, laid out roads, dug canals, and embanked
railways—has invented, and brought to perfection, ploughs,
looms, steam-engines, printing-presses, and machines innumerable—has
built our ships, our vast manufactories,
our docks—has established banks, insurance societies, and
the newspaper press—has covered the sea with lines of
steam-vessels, and the land with electric telegraphs.
Private enterprise has
brought agriculture, manufactures, <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span>
and commerce to their present height, and is now developing
them with increasing rapidity. Therefore, do not trust
private enterprise. On the other hand, the State so fulfils
its judicial function as to ruin many, delude others, and
frighten away those who most need succour; its national
defences are so extravagantly and yet inefficiently administered,
as to call forth almost daily complaint, expostulation,
or ridicule; and as the nation’s steward, it obtains from
some of our vast public estates a minus revenue. Therefore,
trust the State. Slight the good and faithful servant,
and promote the unprofitable one from one talent to ten.</p>

<p>Seriously, the case, while it may not, in some respects,
warrant this parallel, is, in one respect, even stronger. For
the new work is not of the same order as the old, but of a
more difficult order. Ill as government discharges its true
duties, any other duties committed to it are likely to be still
worse discharged. To guard its subjects against aggression,
either individual or national, is a straightforward and
tolerably simple matter; to regulate, directly or indirectly,
the personal actions of those subjects is an infinitely complicated
matter. It is one thing to secure to each man the
unhindered power to pursue his own good; it is a widely
different thing to pursue the good for him. To do the first
efficiently, the State has merely to look on while its citizens
act; to forbid unfairness; to adjudicate when called on;
and to enforce restitution for injuries. To do the last
efficiently, it must become an ubiquitous worker—must
know each man’s needs better than he knows them himself—must,
in short, possess superhuman power and intelligence.
Even, therefore, had the State done well in its
proper sphere, no sufficient warrant would have existed for
extending that sphere; but seeing how ill it has discharged
those simple offices which we cannot help consigning to it,
small indeed is the probability that it will discharge well
offices of a more complicated nature.</p>

<p>Change the point of view however we
may, and this <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
conclusion still presents itself. If we define the primary State-duty
to be that of protecting each individual against others;
then, all other State-action comes under the definition of
protecting each individual against himself—against his own
stupidity, his own idleness, his own improvidence, rashness,
or other defect—his own incapacity for doing something or
other which should be done. There is no questioning this
classification. For manifestly all the obstacles that lie
between a man’s desires and the satisfaction of them, are
either obstacles arising from other men’s counter desires, or
obstacles arising from inability in himself. Such of these
counter desires as are just, have as much claim to satisfaction
as his; and may not, therefore, be thwarted. Such of
them as are unjust, it is the State’s duty to hold in check.
The only other possible sphere for it, therefore, is that of
saving the individual from the consequences of his nature,
or, as we say—protecting him against himself. Making no
comment, at present, on the policy of this, and confining
ourselves solely to the practicability of it, let us inquire how
the proposal looks when reduced to its simplest form. Here
are men possessed of instincts, and sentiments, and perceptions,
all conspiring to self-preservation. The due action of
each brings its quantum of pleasure; the inaction, its more
or less of pain. Those provided with these faculties in due
proportions, prosper and multiply; those ill-provided, tend
to die out. And the general success of this human organization
is seen in the fact, that under it the world has been
peopled, and by it the complicated appliances and arrangements
of civilized life have been developed. It is complained,
however, that there are certain directions in which this
apparatus of motives works but imperfectly. While it is
admitted that men are duly prompted by it to bodily sustenance,
to the obtainment of clothing and shelter, to
marriage and the care of offspring, and to the establishment
of the more important industrial and commercial agencies;
it is argued that there are many desiderata,
as pure air, <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
more knowledge, good water, safe travelling, and so forth,
which it does not duly achieve. And these short-comings
being assumed permanent, it is urged that some supplementary
means must be employed. It is therefore proposed
that out of the mass of men a certain number, constituting
the legislature, shall be instructed to attain these various
objects. The legislators thus instructed (all characterized,
on the average, by the same defects in this apparatus of
motives as men in general), being unable personally to
fulfil their tasks, must fulfil them by deputy—must appoint
commissions, boards, councils, and staffs of officers; and
must construct their agencies of this same defective
humanity that acts so ill. Why now should this system
of complex deputation succeed where the system of
simple deputation does not? The industrial, commercial,
and philanthropic agencies, which citizens form
spontaneously, are directly deputed agencies; these
governmental agencies made by electing legislators who
appoint officers, are indirectly deputed ones. And it is
hoped that, by this process of double deputation, things
may be achieved which the process of single deputation
will not achieve. What is the rationale of this hope? Is
it that legislators, and their employés, are made to feel
more intensely than the rest these evils they are to remedy,
these wants they are to satisfy? Hardly; for by position
they are mostly relieved from such evils and wants. Is it,
then, that they are to have the primary motive replaced by
a secondary motive—the fear of public displeasure, and
ultimate removal from office? Why scarcely; for the
minor benefits which citizens will not organize to secure
<i>directly</i>, they will not organize to secure <i>indirectly</i>, by
turning out inefficient servants: especially if they cannot
readily get efficient ones. Is it, then, that these State-agents
are to do from a sense of duty, what they would not
do from any other motive? Evidently this is the only
possibility remaining. The proposition
on which the <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
advocates of much government have to fall back, is, that
things which the people will not unite to effect for personal
benefit, a law-appointed portion of them will unite to effect
for the benefit of the rest. Public men and functionaries
love their neighbours better than themselves! The
philanthropy of statesmen is stronger than the selfishness
of citizens!</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that every day adds to the list of
legislative miscarriages. If colliery explosions increase,
notwithstanding the appointment of coal-mine inspectors,
why it is but a natural sequence to these false methods. If
Sunderland shipowners complain that, as far as tried, “the
Mercantile Marine Act has proved a total failure;” and if,
meanwhile, the other class affected by it—the sailors—show
their disapprobation by extensive strikes; why it does but
exemplify the folly of trusting a theorising benevolence
rather than an experienced self-interest. On all sides we
may expect such facts; and on all sides we find them.
Government, turning engineer, appoints its lieutenant, the
Sewers’ Commission, to drain London. Presently Lambeth
sends deputations to say that it pays heavy rates, and gets
no benefit. Tired of waiting, Bethnal-green calls meetings
to consider “the most effectual means of extending the
drainage of the district.” From Wandsworth come complainants,
who threaten to pay no more until something is
done. Camberwell proposes to raise a subscription and do
the work itself. Meanwhile, no progress is made towards
the purification of the Thames; the weekly returns show an
increasing rate of mortality; in Parliament, the friends of
the Commission have nothing save good intentions to urge
in mitigation of censure; and, at length, despairing
ministers gladly seize an excuse for quietly shelving the
Commission and its plans altogether.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn27" id="fnanch27">27</a>
As architectural <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span>
surveyor, the State has scarcely succeeded better than as
engineer; witness the Metropolitan Buildings’ Act. New
houses still tumble down from time to time. A few months
since two fell at Bayswater, and one more recently near the
Pentonville Prison: all notwithstanding prescribed thicknesses,
and hoop-iron bond, and inspectors. It never struck
those who provided these delusive sureties, that it was
possible to build walls without bonding the two surfaces
together, so that the inner layer might be removed after the
surveyor’s approval. Nor did they foresee that, in dictating
a larger <i>quantity</i> of bricks than experience proved absolutely
needful, they were simply insuring a slow deterioration of
<i>quality</i> to an equivalent extent.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn28" id="fnanch28">28</a>
The government guarantee
for safe passenger ships answers no better than its guarantee
for safe houses. Though the burning of the <i>Amazon</i> arose
from either bad construction or bad stowage, she had
received the Admiralty certificate before sailing. Notwithstanding
official approval, the <i>Adelaide</i> was found, on her
first voyage, to steer ill, to have useless pumps, ports that
let floods of water into the cabins, and coals so near the
furnaces that they twice caught fire. The <i>W. S. Lindsay</i>,
which turned out unfit for sailing, had been passed by the
government agent; and, but for the owner, might have gone
to sea at a great risk of life. The <i>Melbourne</i>—originally a
State-built ship—which took twenty-four days to reach
Lisbon, and then needed to be docked to undergo a thorough
repair, had been duly inspected. And lastly, the notorious
<i>Australian</i>, before her third futile attempt
to proceed on her <span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span>
voyage, had, her owners tell us, received “the full approbation
of the government inspector.” Neither does the like
supervision give security to land-travelling. The iron
bridge at Chester, which, breaking, precipitated a train into
the Dee, had passed under the official eye. Inspection did
not prevent a column on the South-Eastern from being so
placed as to kill a man who put his head out of the carriage
window. The locomotive that burst at Brighton lately, did
so notwithstanding a State-approval given but ten days
previously. And—to look at the facts in the gross—this
system of supervision has not prevented the increase of
railway accidents; which, be it remembered, has arisen
<i>since</i> the system was commenced.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch27" id="fn27">27</a>
So complete
is the failure of this and other sanitary bodies, that, at the
present moment (March, 1854) a number of philanthropic gentlemen are
voluntarily organizing a “Health Fund for London,” with the
view of meeting the threatened invasion of the Cholera;
and the plea for this <i>purely private enterprise</i>, is, that
the Local Boards of Health and Boards of Guardians are
inoperative, from “<i>ignorance</i>, 1st, <i>of the extent of the
danger</i>; 2nd, <i>of the means which experience has discovered
for meeting it; and</i> 3rd, <i>of the comparative security
which those means may produce</i>.”</p>

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch28" id="fn28">28</a>
The <i>Builder</i> remarks, that “the removal of the brick-duties has not yet
produced that improvement in the make of bricks which we ought to find,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but as bad bricks can be obtained for less than good bricks, so long
as houses built of the former will sell as readily as if the better had been
used, no improvement is
to be expected.”</p></div>

<p>“Well; let the State fail. It can but do its best. If it
succeed, so much the better: if it do not, where is the
harm? Surely it is wiser to act, and take the chance of
success, than to do nothing.” To this plea the rejoinder is
that, unfortunately, the results of legislative intervention
are not only negatively bad, but often positively so. Acts
of Parliament do not simply fail; they frequently make
worse. The familiar truth that persecution aids rather
than hinders proscribed doctrines—a truth lately afresh
illustrated by the forbidden work of Gervinus—is a part of
the general truth that legislation often does indirectly, the
reverse of that which it directly aims to do. Thus has it
been with the Metropolitan Buildings’ Act. As was lately
agreed unanimously by the delegates from all the parishes
in London, and as was stated by them to Sir William
Molesworth, this act “has encouraged bad building, and
has been the means of covering the suburbs of the metropolis
with thousands of wretched hovels, which are a disgrace
to a civilized country.” Thus, also, has it been in provincial
towns. The Nottingham Inclosure Act of 1845, by prescribing
the structure of the houses to be built, and the extent
of yard or garden to be allotted to each, has rendered it
impossible to build working-class dwellings
at such moderate <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
rents as to compete with existing ones. It is estimated
that, as a consequence, 10,000 of the population are
debarred from the new homes they would otherwise have,
and are forced to live crowded together in miserable places
unfit for human habitation; and so, in its anxiety to insure
healthy accommodation for artisans, the law has entailed on
them still worse accommodation than before. Thus, too,
has it been with the Passengers’ Act. The terrible fevers
which arose in the Australian emigrant ships a few months
since, causing in the <i>Bourneuf</i> 83 deaths, in the <i>Wanota</i> 39
deaths, in the <i>Marco Polo</i> 53 deaths, and in the <i>Ticonderoga</i>
104 deaths, arose in vessels sent out by the government;
and arose <i>in consequence</i> of the close packing which the
Passengers’ Act authorizes.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn29" id="fnanch29">29</a>
Thus, moreover, has it been
with the safeguards provided by the Mercantile Marine
Act. The examinations devised for insuring the efficiency
of captains, have had the effect of certifying the
superficially-clever and unpractised men, and, as we are
told by a shipowner, rejecting many of the long-tried and
most trustworthy: the general result being that <i>the
ratio of shipwrecks has increased</i>. Thus also has it
happened with Boards of Health, which have, in sundry
cases, exacerbated the evils to be removed; as, for instance,
at Croydon, where, according to the official report, the
measures of the sanitary authorities produced an epidemic,
which attacked 1600 people and killed 70. Thus again has
it been with the Joint Stock Companies Registration Act.
As was shown by Mr. James Wilson, in his late motion for
a select committee on life-assurance associations, this
measure, passed in 1844 to guard the public against bubble
schemes, actually facilitated the rascalities of 1845 and
subsequent years. The legislative sanction, devised as a
guarantee of genuineness, and supposed
by the people to be <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
such, clever adventurers have without difficulty obtained
for the most worthless projects. Having obtained it, an
amount of public confidence has followed which they could
never otherwise have gained. In this way literally
hundreds of sham enterprises that would not else have seen
the light, have been fostered into being; and thousands of
families have been ruined who would never have been so
but for legislative efforts to make them more secure.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch29" id="fn29">29</a>
Against which close packing, by the way,
<i>a private mercantile body</i>—the Liverpool Shipowners’
Association—unavailingly protested when the Act was before
Parliament.</p></div>

<p>Moreover, when these topical remedies applied by
statesmen do not exacerbate the evils they were meant to
cure, they constantly induce collateral evils; and these
often graver than the original ones. It is the vice of this
empirical school of politicians that they never look beyond
proximate causes and immediate effects. In common with
the uneducated masses they habitually regard each phenomenon
as involving but one antecedent and one consequent.
They do not bear in mind that each phenomenon
is a link in an infinite series—is the result of myriads of
preceding phenomena, and will have a share in producing
myriads of succeeding ones. Hence they overlook the fact
that, in disturbing any natural chain of sequences, they are
not only modifying the result next in succession, but all the
future results into which this will enter as a part cause.
The serial genesis of phenomena, and the interaction of
each series upon every other series, produces a complexity
utterly beyond human grasp. Even in the simplest cases
this is so. A servant who puts coals on the fire sees but
few effects from the burning of a lump. The man of
science, however, knows that there are very many effects.
He knows that the combustion establishes numerous
atmospheric currents, and through them moves thousands
of cubic feet of air inside the house and out. He knows
that the heat diffused causes expansions and subsequent
contractions of all bodies within its range. He knows that
the persons warmed are affected in their rate of respiration
and their waste of tissue; and
that these physiological <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
changes must have various secondary results. He knows
that, could he trace to their ramified consequences all the
forces disengaged, mechanical, chemical, thermal, electric—could
he enumerate all the subsequent effects of the
evaporation caused, the gases generated, the light evolved,
the heat radiated; a volume would scarcely suffice to enter
them. If, now, from a simple inorganic change such
numerous and complex results arise, how infinitely multiplied
and involved must be the ultimate consequences of
any force brought to bear upon society. Wonderfully constructed
as it is—mutually dependent as are its members
for the satisfaction of their wants—affected as each unit of
it is by his fellows, not only as to his safety and prosperity,
but in his health, his temper, his culture; the social
organism cannot be dealt with in any one part, without all
other parts being influenced in ways which cannot be
foreseen. You put a duty on paper, and by-and-by find
that, through the medium of the jacquard-cards employed,
you have inadvertently taxed figured silk, sometimes to the
extent of several shillings per piece. On removing the
impost from bricks, you discover that its existence had
increased the dangers of mining, by preventing shafts from
being lined and workings from being tunnelled. By the
excise on soap, you have, it turns out, greatly encouraged
the use of caustic washing-powders; and so have unintentionally
entailed an immense destruction of clothes. In
every case you perceive, on careful inquiry, that besides
acting upon that which you sought to act upon, you have
acted upon many other things, and each of these again on
many others; and so have propagated a multitude of
changes in all directions. We need feel no surprise, then,
that in their efforts to cure specific evils, legislators have
continually caused collateral evils they never looked for.
No Carlyle’s wisest man, nor any body of such, could avoid
causing them. Though their production is explicable
enough after it has occurred, it
is never anticipated. <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
When, under the New Poor-law, provision was made for
the accommodation of vagrants in the Union-houses, it was
hardly expected that a body of tramps would be thereby
called into existence, who would spend their time in walking
from Union to Union throughout the kingdom. It was
little thought by those who in past generations assigned
parish-pay for the maintenance of illegitimate children,
that, as a result, a family of such would by-and-by be
considered a small fortune, and the mother of them a
desirable wife; nor did the same statesmen see that, by
the law of settlement, they were organizing a disastrous
inequality of wages in different districts, and entailing a
system of clearing away cottages, which would result in
the crowding of bedrooms, and in a consequent moral and
physical deterioration. The English tonnage law was
enacted simply with a view to regulate the mode of
measurement. Its framers overlooked the fact that they
were practically providing “for the effectual and compulsory
construction of bad ships;” and that “to cheat
the law, that is, to build a tolerable ship in spite of it, was
the highest achievement left to an English builder.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn30" id="fnanch30">30</a>
Greater commercial security was alone aimed at by the
partnership law. We now find, however, that the unlimited
liability it insists upon is a serious hindrance to
progress; it practically forbids the association of small
capitalists; it is found a great obstacle to the building of
improved dwellings for the people; it prevents a better
relationship between artisans and employers; and by withholding
from the working-classes good investments for
their savings, it checks the growth of provident habits and
encourages drunkenness. Thus on all sides are well-meant
measures producing unforeseen mischiefs—a licensing
law that promotes the adulteration of beer; a ticket-of-leave
system that encourages men to
commit crime; a <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span>
police regulation that forces street-huxters into the workhouse.
And then, in addition to the obvious and proximate
evils, come the remote and less distinguishable ones, which,
could we estimate their accumulated result, we should
probably find even more serious.</p>

Lecture before the Royal Institution, by J.
Scott Russell, Esq., “On Wave-line Ships and Yachts,” Feb.
6, 1852.</p></div>

<p class="padtopb">But the thing to be discussed is, not so much whether,
by any amount of intelligence, it is <i>possible</i> for a government
to work out the various ends consigned to it, as
whether its fulfilment of them is <i>probable</i>. It is less a
question of <i>can</i> than a question of <i>will</i>. Granting the
absolute competence of the State, let us consider what
hope there is of getting from it satisfactory performance.
Let us look at the moving force by which the legislative
machine is worked, and then inquire whether this force is
thus employed as economically as it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>Manifestly, as desire of some kind is the invariable
stimulus to action in the individual, every social agency, of
what nature soever, must have some aggregate of desires
for its motive power. Men in their collective capacity can
exhibit no result but what has its origin in some appetite,
feeling, or taste common among them. Did not they like
meat, there could be no cattle-graziers, no Smithfield, no
distributing organization of butchers. Operas, Philharmonic
Societies, song-books, and street organ-boys, have
all been called into being by our love of music. Look
through the trades’ directory; take up a guide to the
London sights; read the index of Bradshaw’s time-tables,
the reports of the learned societies, or the advertisements
of new books; and you see in the publication itself, and in
the things it describes, so many products of human activities,
stimulated by human desires. Under this stimulus grow up
agencies alike the most gigantic and the most insignificant, the
most complicated and the most simple—agencies for national
defence and for the sweeping of crossings; for the daily distribution
of letters, and for the collection of bits
of coal out <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
of the Thames mud—agencies that subserve all ends, from
the preaching of Christianity to the protection of ill-treated
animals; from the production of bread for a nation to the
supply of groundsel for caged singing-birds. The accumulated
desires of individuals being, then, the moving power
by which every social agency is worked, the question to be
considered is—Which is the most economical kind of
agency? The agency having no power in itself, but being
merely an instrument, our inquiry must be for the most
efficient instrument—the instrument that costs least, and
wastes the smallest amount of the moving power—the instrument
least liable to get out of order, and most readily
put right again when it goes wrong. Of the two kinds of
social mechanism exemplified above, the spontaneous and
the governmental, which is the best?</p>

<p>From the form of this question will be readily foreseen
the intended answer—that is the best mechanism which
contains the fewest parts. The common saying—“What
you wish well done you must do yourself,” embodies a truth,
equally applicable to political life as to private life. The
experience that farming by bailiff entails loss, while tenant-farming
pays, is an experience still better illustrated in
national history than in a landlord’s account books. This
transference of power from con­stit­uen­cies to members of
parliament, from these to the executive, from the executive
to a board, from the board to inspectors, and from inspectors
through their subs down to the actual workers—this
operating through a series of levers, each, of which absorbs
in friction and inertia part of the moving force; is as bad,
in virtue of its complexity, as the direct employment by
society of individuals, private companies, and spontaneously-formed
institutions, is good in virtue of its simplicity.
Fully to appreciate the contrast, we must compare in detail
the working of the two systems.</p>

<p>Officialism is habitually slow. When non-governmental
agencies are dilatory, the public has its
remedy: it ceases <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
to employ them and soon finds quicker ones. Under this
discipline all private bodies are taught promptness. But
for delays in State-departments there is no such easy cure.
Life-long Chancery suits must be patiently borne; Museum-catalogues
must be wearily waited for. While, by the
people themselves, a Crystal Palace is designed, erected,
and filled, in the course of a few months, the legislature
takes twenty years to build itself a new house. While,
by private persons, the debates are daily printed and dispersed
over the kingdom within a few hours of their utterance,
the Board of Trade tables are regularly published a
month, and sometimes more, after date. And so throughout.
Here is a Board of Health which, since 1849, has
been about to close the metropolitan graveyards, but has
not done it yet; and which has so long dawdled over projects
for cemeteries, that the London Necropolis Company
has taken the matter out of its hands. Here is a patentee
who has had fourteen years’ correspondence with the
Horse Guards, before getting a definite answer respecting
the use of his improved boot for the Army. Here is a
Plymouth port-admiral who delays sending out to look for
the missing boats of the Amazon until ten days after
the wreck.</p>

<p>Again, officialism is stupid. Under the natural course
of things each citizen tends towards his fittest function.
Those who are competent to the kind of work they undertake,
succeed, and, in the average of cases, are advanced
in proportion to their efficiency; while the incompetent,
society soon finds out, ceases to employ, forces to try something
easier, and eventually turns to use. But it is quite
otherwise in State-organizations. Here, as every one knows,
birth, age, back-stairs intrigue, and sycophancy, determine
the selections rather than merit. The “fool of the family”
readily finds a place in the Church, if “the family” have
good connexions. A youth too ill-educated for any profession,
does very well for an officer in
the Army. Grey <span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span>
hair, or a title, is a far better guarantee of naval promotion
than genius is. Nay, indeed, the man of capacity often
finds that, in government offices, superiority is a hindrance—that
his chiefs hate to be pestered with his proposed improvements,
and are offended by his implied criticisms.
Not only, therefore, is legislative machinery complex, but
it is made of inferior materials. Hence the blunders we
daily read of—the supplying to the dockyards from the
royal forests of timber unfit for use; the ad­min­i­stra­tion
of relief during the Irish famine in such a manner as to
draw labourers from the field, and diminish the subsequent
harvest by one-fourth<a class="afnanch" href="#fn31" id="fnanch31">31</a>; the filing of patents at three
different offices and keeping an index at none. Everywhere
does this bungling show itself, from the elaborate
failure of House of Commons ventilation down to the
publication of <i>The London Gazette</i>, which invariably comes
out wrongly folded.</p>

<p>A further characteristic of officialism is its extravagance.
In its chief departments, Army, Navy, and Church, it
employs far more officers than are needful, and pays some
of the useless ones exorbitantly. The work done by the
Sewers Commission has cost, as Sir B. Hall tells us, from
300 to 400 per cent, over the contemplated outlay; while
the management charges have reached 35, 40, and 45 per
cent. on the expenditure. The trustees of Ramsgate
Harbour—a harbour, by the way, that has taken a century
to complete—are spending 18,000<i>l.</i> a year in doing what
5000<i>l.</i> has been proved sufficient for. The Board of Health
is causing new surveys to be made of all the towns under
its control—a proceeding which, as Mr. Stephenson states,
and as every tyro in engineering knows, is, for drainage
purposes, a wholly needless expense. These public agencies
are subject to no such influence as that which obliges private
enterprise to be economical. Traders and mercantile
bodies succeed by serving society cheaply.
Such of them <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>
as cannot do this are continually supplanted by those who
can. They cannot saddle the nation with the results of
their extravagance, and so are prevented from being extravagant.
On works that are to return a profit it does
not answer to spend 48 per cent. of the capital in superintendence,
as in the engineering department of the Indian
Government; and Indian railway companies, knowing
this, manage to keep their superintendence charges within
8 per cent. A shopkeeper leaves out of his accounts no
item analogous to that 6,000,000<i>l.</i> of its revenues, which
Parliament allows to be deducted on the way to the Exchequer.
Walk through a manufactory, and you see that
the stern alternatives, carefulness or ruin, dictate the saving
of every penny; visit one of the national dockyards, and
the comments you make on any glaring wastefulness are
carelessly met by the slang phrase―“Nunky pays.”</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch31" id="fn31">31</a>
See Evidence of Major Larcom.</p></div>

<p>The unadaptiveness of officialism is another of its vices.
Unlike private enterprise which quickly modifies its actions
to meet emergencies—unlike the shopkeeper who promptly
finds the wherewith to satisfy a sudden demand—unlike
the railway company which doubles its trains to carry a
special influx of passengers; the law-made instrumentality
lumbers on under all varieties of circumstances through its
ordained routine at its habitual rate. By its very nature it
is fitted only for average requirements, and inevitably fails
under unusual requirements. You cannot step into the
street without having the contrast thrust upon you. Is it
summer? You see the water-carts going their prescribed
rounds with scarcely any regard to the needs of the weather—to-day
sprinkling afresh the already moist roads; to-morrow
bestowing their showers with no greater liberality
upon roads cloudy with dust. Is it winter? You see the
scavengers do not vary in number and activity according
to the quantity of mud; and if there comes a heavy fall
of snow, you find the thoroughfares remaining for nearly
a week in a scarcely passable state, without
an effort being <span class="xxpn" id="p250">{250}</span>
made, even in the heart of London, to meet the exigency.
The late snow-storm, indeed, supplied a neat antithesis
between the two orders of agencies in the effects it respectively
produced on omnibuses and cabs. Not being under
a law-fixed tariff, the omnibuses put on extra horses
and raised their fares. The cabs on the contrary, being
limited in their charges by an Act of Parliament which,
with the usual shortsightedness, never contemplated
such a contingency as this, declined to ply, deserted the
stands and the stations, left luckless travellers to stumble
home with their luggage as best they might, and so became
useless at the very time of all others when they were most
wanted! Not only by its unsusceptibility of adjustment
does officialism entail serious inconveniences, but it likewise
entails great injustices. In this case of cabs for
example, it has resulted since the late change of law, that
old cabs, which were before saleable at 10<i>l.</i> and 12<i>l.</i> each,
are now unsaleable and have to be broken up; and thus
legislation has robbed cab-proprietors of part of their
capital. Again, the recently-passed Smoke-Bill for London,
which applies only within certain prescribed limits, has
the effect of taxing one manufacturer while leaving untaxed
his competitor working within a quarter of a mile; and
so, as we are credibly informed, gives one an advantage of
1500<i>l.</i> a year over another. These typify the infinity of
wrongs, varying in degrees of hardship, which legal regulations
necessarily involve. Society, a living growing
organism, placed within apparatuses of dead, rigid, mechanical
formulas, cannot fail to be hampered and pinched.
The only agencies which can efficiently serve it, are those
through which its pulsations hourly flow, and which change
as it changes.</p>

<p>How invariably officialism becomes corrupt every one
knows. Exposed to no such antiseptic as free competition—not
dependent for existence, as private unendowed
organizations are, on the maintenance
of a vigorous <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
vitality; all law-made agencies fall into an inert, over-fed
state, from which to disease is a short step. Salaries
flow in irrespective of the activity with which duty is performed;
continue after duty wholly ceases; become rich
prizes for the idle well born; and prompt to perjury, to
bribery, to simony. East India directors are elected not
for any administrative capacity they have; but they buy
votes by promised patronage—a patronage alike asked
and given in utter disregard of the welfare of a hundred
millions of people. Registrars of wills not only get many
thousands a year each for doing work which their miserably
paid deputies leave half done; but they, in some cases,
defraud the revenue, and that after repeated reprimands.
Dockyard promotion is the result not of efficient services,
but of political favouritism. That they may continue to
hold rich livings, clergymen preach what they do not
believe; bishops make false returns of their revenues; and
at their elections to fellowships, well-to-do priests severally
make oath that they are <i>pauper</i>, <i>pius et doctus</i>. From the
local inspector whose eyes are shut to an abuse by a contractor’s
present, up to the prime minister who finds lucrative
berths for his relations, this venality is daily illustrated;
and that in spite of public reprobation and perpetual
attempts to prevent it. As we once heard said by a State-official
of twenty-five years’ standing—“Wherever there is
government there is villainy.” It is the inevitable result of
destroying the direct connexion between the profit obtained
and the work performed. No incompetent person hopes,
by offering a <i>douceur</i> in the <i>Times</i> to get a permanent place
in a mercantile office. But where, as under government,
there is no employer’s self-interest to forbid—where the
appointment is made by some one on whom inefficiency
entails no loss; there a <i>douceur</i> is operative. In hospitals,
in public charities, in endowed schools, in all social agencies
in which duty done and income gained do not go hand in
hand, the like corruption is found; and
is great in <span class="xxpn" id="p252">{252}</span>
proportion as the dependence of income upon duty is remote. In
State-organizations, therefore, corruption is unavoidable.
In trading-organizations it rarely makes its appearance;
and when it does, the instinct of self-preservation soon
provides a remedy.</p>

<p>To all which broad contrasts add this, that while private
bodies are enterprising and progressive, public bodies are unchanging,
and, indeed, obstructive. That officialism should
be inventive nobody expects. That it should go out of its
easy mechanical routine to introduce improvements, and this
at a considerable expense of thought and application, without
the prospect of profit, is not to be supposed. But it is
not simply stationary; it resists every amendment either
in itself or in anything with which it deals. Until now
that County Courts are taking away their practice, all
agents of the law have doggedly opposed law-reform. The
universities have maintained an old <i>curriculum</i> for centuries
after it ceased to be fit; and are now struggling to prevent
a threatened reconstruction. Every postal improvement
has been vehemently protested against by the postal authorities.
Mr. Whiston can say how pertinacious is the conservatism
of Church grammar-schools. Not even the
gravest consequences in view preclude official resistance:
witness the fact that though, as already mentioned, Professor
Barlow reported in 1820, of the Admiralty compasses
then in store, that “at least one-half were mere lumber,”
yet notwithstanding the constant risk of shipwrecks thence
arising, “very little amelioration in this state of things
appears to have taken place until 1838 to 1840.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn32" id="fnanch32">32</a>
Nor is
official obstructiveness to be readily overborne even by a
powerful public opinion: witness the fact that though, for
generations, nine-tenths of the nation have disapproved
this ecclesiastical system which pampers the drones and
starves the workers, and though commissions have been
appointed to rectify it, it still remains
substantially as it <span class="xxpn" id="p253">{253}</span>
was: witness again the fact that though, since 1818, there
have been a score attempts to rectify the scandalous malad­min­i­stra­tion
of Charitable Trusts—though ten times in
ten successive years, remedial measures have been brought
before Parliament—the abuses still continue in all their
grossness. Not only do these legal in­stru­men­tal­i­ties resist
reforms in themselves, but they hinder reforms in other
things. In defending their vested interests the clergy
delay the closing of town burial-grounds. As Mr. Lindsay
can show, government emigration-agents are checking the
use of iron for sailing-vessels. Excise officers prevent
improvements in the processes they have to overlook. That
organic conservatism which is visible in the daily conduct
of all men, is an obstacle which in private life self-interest
slowly overcomes. The prospect of profit does, in the end,
teach farmers that deep draining is good; though it takes
long to do this. Manufacturers do, ultimately, learn the
most economical speed at which to work their steam-engines;
though precedent has long misled them. But in
the public service, where there is no self-interest to overcome
it, this conservatism exerts its full force; and produces
results alike disastrous and absurd. For generations after
book-keeping had become universal, the Exchequer accounts
were kept by notches cut on sticks. In the estimates for
the current year appears the item, “Trimming the oil-lamps
at the Horse-Guards.”</p>

<p>Between these law-made agencies and the spontaneously
formed ones, who then can hesitate? The one class are
slow, stupid, extravagant, unadaptive, corrupt, and obstructive:
can any point out in the other, vices that balance
these? It is true that trade has its dishonesties, speculation
its follies. These are evils inevitably entailed by the existing
imperfections of humanity. It is equally true, however,
that these imperfections of humanity are shared by State-functionaries;
and that being unchecked in them by the
same stern discipline, they grow to
far worse results. <span class="xxpn" id="p254">{254}</span>
Given a race of men having a certain proclivity to misconduct
and the question is, whether a society of these
men shall be so organized that ill-conduct directly brings
punishment, or whether it shall be so organized that
punishment is but remotely contingent on ill-conduct?
Which will be the most healthful community—that in which
agents who perform their functions badly, immediately
suffer by the withdrawal of public patronage; or that in
which such agents can be made to suffer only through an
apparatus of meetings, petitions, polling booths, parliamentary
divisions, cabinet-councils, and red-tape documents?
Is it not an absurdly utopian hope that men will behave
better when correction is far removed and uncertain than
when it is near at hand and inevitable? Yet this is
the hope which most political schemers unconsciously
cherish. Listen to their plans, and you find that just
what they propose to have done, they assume the appointed
agents will do. That functionaries are trustworthy is
their first postulate. Doubtless could good officers be
ensured, much might be said for officialism; just as
despotism would have its advantages could we ensure a
good despot.</p>

<p>If, however, we would duly appreciate the contrast
between the artificial modes and the natural modes of
achieving social desiderata, we must look not only at the
vices of the one but at the virtues of the other. These are
many and important. Consider first how immediately
every private enterprise is dependent on the need for it;
and how impossible it is for it to continue if there be no
need. Daily are new trades and new companies established.
If they subserve some existing public want, they take root
and grow. If they do not, they die of inanition. It needs
no agitation, no act of Parliament, to put them down. As
with all natural organizations, if there is no function for
them no nutriment comes to them, and they dwindle away.
Moreover, not only do the new agencies
disappear if they <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
are superfluous, but the old ones cease to be when they
have done their work. Unlike public in­stru­men­tal­i­ties—unlike
Heralds’ Offices, which are maintained for ages after
heraldry has lost all value—unlike Ecclesiastial Courts,
which continue to flourish for generations after they have
become an abomination; these private in­stru­men­tal­i­ties
dissolve when they become needless. A widely ramified
coaching-system ceases to exist as soon as a more efficient
railway-system comes into being. And not simply does it
cease to exist, and to abstract funds, but the materials
of which it was made are absorbed and turned to use.
Coachmen, guards, and the rest, are employed to profit
elsewhere—do not continue for twenty years a burden, like
the compensated officials of some abolished department of
the State. Consider, again, how necessarily these unordained
agencies fit themselves to their work. It is a law
of all organized things that efficiency presupposes apprenticeship.
Not only is it true that the young merchant must
begin by carrying letters to the post, that the way to be a
successful innkeeper is to commence as waiter—not only is
it true that in the development of the intellect there must
come first the perceptions of identity and duality, next of
number, and that without these, arithmetic, algebra, and
the infinitesimal calculus, remain impracticable; but it is
true that there is no part of an organism but begins in
some simple form with some insignificant function, and
passes to its final stage through successive phases of
complexity. Every heart is at first a mere pulsatile sac;
every brain begins as a slight enlargement of the spinal
chord. This law equally extends to the social organism.
An instrumentality that is to work well must not be designed
and suddenly put together by legislators, but must
grow gradually from a germ; each successive addition
must be tried and proved good by experience before
another addition is made; and by this tentative process
only, can an efficient instrumentality be
produced. From a <span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
trustworthy man who receives deposits of money, insensibly
grows up a vast banking system, with its notes, checks,
bills, its complex transactions, and its Clearing-house.
Pack-horses, then waggons, then coaches, then steam-carriages
on common roads, and, finally, steam-carriages
on roads made for them—such has been the slow genesis
of our present means of communication. Not a trade in the
directory but has formed itself an apparatus of manufacturers,
brokers, travellers, and retailers, in so gradual a
way that no one can trace the steps. And so with organizations
of another order. The Zoological Gardens began
as the private collection of a few naturalists. The best
working-class school known—that at Price’s factory—commenced
with half-a-dozen boys sitting among the
candle-boxes, after hours, to teach themselves writing with
worn-out pens. Mark, too, that as a consequence of their
mode of growth, these spontaneously-formed agencies
expand to any extent required. The same stimulus which
brought them into being makes them send their ramifications
wherever they are needed. But supply does not
thus readily follow demand in governmental agencies.
Appoint a board and a staff, fix their duties, and let
the apparatus have a generation or two to consolidate,
and you cannot get it to fulfil larger requirements without
some act of parliament obtained only after long delay
and difficulty.</p>

<p>Were there space, much more might be said upon the
superiority of what naturalists would call the <i>exogenous</i>
order of institutions over the <i>endogenous</i> one. But, from
the point of view indicated, the further contrasts between
their char­ac­ter­is­tics will be sufficiently visible.</p>

<p>Hence then the fact, that while the one order of means
is ever failing, making worse, or producing more evils than
it cures, the other order of means is ever succeeding, ever
improving. Strong as it looks at the outset, State-agency
perpetually disappoints every one. Puny as
are its first <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span>
stages, private effort daily achieves results that astound
the world. It is not only that joint-stock companies do so
much—it is not only that by them a whole kingdom is
covered with railways in the same time that it takes the
Admiralty to build a hundred-gun ship; but it is that
public in­stru­men­tal­i­ties are outdone even by individuals.
The often quoted contrast between the Academy whose
forty members took fifty-six years to compile the French
Dictionary, while Dr. Johnson alone compiled the English
one in eight—a contrast still marked enough after making
due set-off for the difference in the works—is by no means
without parallel. That great sanitary desideratum—the
bringing of the New River to London—which the
wealthiest corporation in the world attempted and failed,
Sir Hugh Myddleton achieved single-handed. The first
canal in England—a work of which government might
have been thought the fit projector, and the only competent
executor—was undertaken and finished as the private
speculation of one man—the Duke of Bridgewater. By
his own unaided exertions, William Smith completed that
great achievement, the geological map of Great Britain;
meanwhile, the Ordnance Survey—a very accurate and
elaborate one, it is true—has already occupied a large
staff for some two generations, and will not be completed
before the lapse of another. Howard and the prisons of
Europe; Bianconi and Irish travelling; Waghorn and the
Overland route; Dargan and the Dublin Exhibition—do
not these suggest startling contrasts? While private
gentlemen like Mr. Denison, build model lodging-houses
in which the deaths are greatly below the average, the
State builds barracks in which the deaths are greatly
above the average, even of the much-pitied town populations:
barracks which, though filled with picked men
under medical supervision, show an annual mortality per
thousand of 13·6, 17·9 and even 20·4; though among
civilians of the same age in the same
places, the mortality <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span>
per thousand is but 11·9.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn33" id="fnanch33">33</a>
While the State has laid out
large sums at Parkhurst in the effort to reform juvenile
criminals, who are <i>not</i> reformed, Mr. Ellis takes fifteen of
the worst young thieves in London—thieves considered
by the police irreclaimable—and reforms them all. Side
by side with the Emigration Board, under whose management
hundreds die of fever from close packing, and under
whose licence sail vessels which, like the <i>Washington</i>,
are the homes of fraud, brutality, tyranny, and obscenity,
stands Mrs. Chisholm’s Family Colonisation Loan Society,
which does not provide worse accommodation than ever
before but much better; which does not demoralize by
promiscuous crowding but improves by mild discipline;
which does not pauperize by charity but encourages
providence; which does not increase our taxes, but is
self-supporting. Here are lessons for the lovers of legislation.
The State outdone by a working shoemaker! The
State beaten by a woman!</p>

<p>Stronger still becomes this contrast between the results
of public action and private action, when we remember that
the one is constantly eked out by the other, even in doing
the things unavoidably left to it. Passing over military
and naval departments, in which much is done by contractors
and not by men receiving government pay,—passing over
the Church, which is constantly extended not by law but by
voluntary effort—passing over the Universities, where the
efficient teaching is given not by the appointed officers but by
private tutors; let us look at the mode in which our judicial
system is worked. Lawyers perpetually tell us that codification
is impossible; and some are simple enough to believe
them. Merely remarking, in passing, that what government
and all its employés cannot do for the Acts of Parliament
in general, was done for the 1500 Customs acts in 1825 by
the energy of one man—Mr. Deacon
Hume—let us see <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span>
how the absence of a digested system of law is made good.
In preparing themselves for the bar, and finally the bench,
law-students, by years of research, have to gain an
acquaintance with this vast mass of unorganized legislation;
and that organization which it is held impossible for
the State to effect, it is held possible (sly sarcasm on the
State!) for each student to effect for himself. Every judge
can privately codify, though “united wisdom” cannot. But
how is each judge enabled to codify? By the private
enterprise of men who have prepared the way for him; by
the partial codifications of Blackstone, Coke, and others;
by the digests of Partnership Law, Bankruptcy Law, Law
of Patents, Laws affecting Women, and the rest that daily
issue from the press; by abstracts of cases, and volumes of
reports—every one of them unofficial products. Sweep
away all these fractional codifications made by individuals,
and the State would be in utter ignorance of its own laws!
Had not the bunglings of legislators been made good by
private enterprise, the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice would have
been impossible!</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch33" id="fn33">33</a>
See “Statistical Reports on the Sickness, Mortality, and Invaliding
amongst the Troops.” 1853.</p></div>

<p>Where, then, is the warrant for the constantly-proposed
extensions of legislative action? If, as we have seen in a
large class of cases, government measures do not remedy
the evils they aim at; if, in another large class, they make
these evils worse instead of remedying them; and if, in a
third large class, while curing some evils they entail others,
and often greater ones—if, as we lately saw, public action
is continually outdone in efficiency by private action; and
if, as just shown, private action is obliged to make up for
the shortcomings of public action, even in fulfilling the
vital functions of the State; what reason is there for
wishing more public ad­min­i­stra­tions? The advocates of
such may claim credit for philanthropy, but not for wisdom;
unless wisdom is shown by disregarding experience.</p>

<p class="padtopb">“Much of this argument is beside
the question,” will <span class="xxpn" id="p260">{260}</span>
rejoin our opponents. “The true point at issue is, not
whether individuals and companies outdo the State when
they come in competition with it, but whether there are not
certain social wants which the State alone can satisfy.
Admitting that private enterprise does much, and does it
well, it is nevertheless true that we have daily thrust upon
our notice many desiderata which it has not achieved, and is
not achieving. In these cases its incompetency is obvious;
and in these cases, therefore, it behoves the State to make
up for its deficiencies: doing this, if not well, yet as well
as it can.”</p>

<p>Not to fall back upon the many experiences already
quoted, showing that the State is likely to do more harm
than good in attempting this; nor to dwell upon the fact
that, in most of the alleged cases, the apparent insufficiency
of private enterprise is a <i>result</i> of previous State-interferences,
as may be conclusively shown; let us deal with
the proposition on its own terms. Though there would
have been no need for a Mercantile Marine Act to prevent
the unseaworthiness of ships and the ill-treatment of
sailors, had there been no Navigation Laws to produce
these; and though were all like cases of evils and shortcomings
directly or indirectly produced by law, taken out
of the category, there would probably remain but small
basis for the plea above put; yet let it be granted that,
every artificial obstacle having been removed, there would
still remain many desiderata unachieved, which there was
no seeing how spontaneous effort could achieve. Let all
this, we say, be granted; the propriety of legislative action
may yet be rightly questioned.</p>

<p>For the said plea involves the unwarrantable assumption
that social agencies will continue to work only as they are
now working; and will produce no results but those they
seem likely to produce. It is the habit of this school of
thinkers to make a limited human intelligence the measure
of phenomena which it requires
omniscience to grasp. <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span>
That which it does not see the way to, it does not believe
will take place. Though society has, generation after
generation, been growing to developments which none foresaw,
yet there is no practical belief in unforeseen developments
in the future. The parliamentary debates constitute
an elaborate balancing of probabilities, having for data
things as they are. Meanwhile every day adds new
elements to things as they are, and seemingly improbable
results constantly occur. Who, a few years ago, expected
that a Leicester-square refugee would shortly become
Emperor of the French? Who looked for free trade from
a landlords’ ministry? Who dreamed that Irish over-population
would spontaneously cure itself, as it is now
doing? So far from social changes arising in likely ways,
they usually arise in ways which, to common sense, appear
unlikely. A barber’s shop was not a probable-looking
place for the germination of the cotton manufacture. No
one supposed that important agricultural improvements
would come from a Leadenhall-street tradesman. A farmer
would have been the last man thought of to bring to bear
the screw propulsion of steam-ships. The invention of a
new species of architecture we should have hoped from any
one rather than a gardener. Yet while the most unexpected
changes are daily wrought out in the strangest
ways, legislation daily assumes that things will go just as
human foresight thinks they will go. Though by the trite
exclamation—“What would our forefathers have said!”
there is a frequent acknowledgment of the fact that wonderful
results have been achieved in modes wholly unforeseen, yet
there seems no belief that this will be again. Would
it not be wise to admit such a probability into our
politics? May we not rationally infer that, as in the past
so in the future?</p>

<p>This strong faith in State-agencies is, however, accompanied
by so weak a faith in natural agencies (the two being
antagonistic), that, spite of past experience,
it will by <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span>
many be thought absurd to rest in the conviction that
existing social needs will be spontaneously met, though we
cannot say how they will be met. Nevertheless, illustrations
exactly to the point are now transpiring before
their eyes. Instance the scarcely credible phenomenon
lately witnessed in the midland counties. Every one has
heard of the distress of the stockingers—a chronic evil of
some generation or two’s standing. Repeated petitions
have prayed Parliament for remedy; and legislation has
made attempts, but without success. The disease seemed
incurable. Two or three years since, however, the circular
knitting machine was introduced—a machine immensely
outstripping the old stocking-frame in productiveness, but
which can make only the legs of stockings, not the feet.
Doubtless, the Leicester and Nottingham artizans regarded
this new engine with alarm, as likely to intensify their
miseries. On the contrary, it has wholly removed them.
By cheapening production it has so enormously increased
consumption, that the old stocking-frames, which were
before too many by half for the work to be done, are now
all employed in putting feet to the legs which the new
machines make. How insane would he have been thought
who anticipated cure from such a cause! If from the
unforeseen removal of evils we turn to the unforeseen
achievement of desiderata, we find like cases. No one
recognized in Oersted’s electro-magnetic discovery the
germ of a new agency for the catching of criminals and
the facilitation of commerce. No one expected railways to
become agents for the diffusion of cheap literature, as they
now are. No one supposed when the Society of Arts was
planning an international exhibition of manufactures in
Hyde Park, that the result would be a place for popular
recreation and culture at Sydenham.</p>

<p>But there is yet a deeper reply to the appeals of impatient
philanthropists. It is not simply that social vitality may be
trusted by-and-by to
fulfil each much-exaggerated <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
requirement in some quiet spontaneous way—it is not simply that
when thus naturally fulfilled it will be fulfilled efficiently,
instead of being botched as when attempted artificially;
but it is that until thus naturally fulfilled it ought not to
be fulfilled at all. A startling paradox, this, to many; but
one quite justifiable, as we hope shortly to show.</p>

<p>It was pointed out some distance back, that the force
which produces and sets in motion every social mechanism—governmental,
mercantile, or other—is some accumulation
of personal desires. As there is no individual action
without a desire, so, it was urged, there can be no social
action without an aggregate of desires. To which there
here remains to add, that as it is a general law of the
individual that the intenser desires—those corresponding
to all-essential functions—are satisfied first, and if need be
to the neglect of the weaker and less important ones; so,
it must be a general law of society that the chief requisites
of social life—those necessary to popular existence and
multiplication—will, in the natural order of things, be subserved
before those of a less pressing kind. As the private
man first ensures himself food; then clothing and shelter;
these being secured, takes a wife; and, if he can afford it,
presently supplies himself with carpeted rooms, and piano,
and wines, hires servants and gives dinner parties; so, in
the evolution of society, we see first a combination for
defence against enemies, and for the better pursuit of
game; by-and-by come such political arrangements as are
needed to maintain this combination; afterwards, under a
demand for more food, more clothes, more houses, arises
division of labour; and when satisfaction of the animal
wants has been provided for, there slowly grow up literature,
science, and the arts. Is it not obvious that these
successive evolutions occur in the order of their importance?
Is it not obvious, that, being each of them produced by an
aggregate of desires, they <i>must</i> occur in the order of their
importance, if it be a law of the
individual that the <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
strongest desires correspond to the most needful actions?
Is it not, indeed, obvious that the order of relative importance
will be more uniformly followed in social action than
in individual action; seeing that the personal idiosyncrasies
which disturb that order in the latter case are <i>averaged</i> in
the former? If any one does not see this, let him take up
a book describing life at the gold-diggings. There he will
find the whole process exhibited in little. He will read
that as the diggers must eat, they are compelled to offer
such prices for food that it pays better to keep a store than
to dig. As the store-keepers must get supplies, they give
enormous sums for carriage from the nearest town; and
some men, quickly seeing they can get rich at that, make it
their business. This brings drays and horses into demand;
the high rates draw these from all quarters; and, after
them, wheelwrights and harness-makers. Blacksmiths to
sharpen pickaxes, doctors to cure fevers, get pay exorbitant
in proportion to the need for them; and are so brought
flocking in proportionate numbers. Presently commodities
become scarce; more must be fetched from abroad; sailors
must have increased wages to prevent them from deserting
and turning miners; this necessitates higher charges for
freight; higher freights quickly bring more ships; and so
there rapidly develops an organization for supplying goods
from all parts of the world. Every phase of this evolution
takes place in the order of its necessity; or as we say—in
the order of the intensity of the desires subserved.
Each man does that which he finds pays best; that
which pays best is that for which other men will give
most; that for which they will give most is that which,
under the circumstances, they most desire. Hence the
succession must be throughout from the more important
to the less important. A requirement which at any period
remains unfulfilled, must be one for the fulfilment of which
men will not pay so much as to make it worth any one’s
while to fulfil it—must be a <i>less</i> requirement
than all the <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
others for the fulfilment of which they will pay more; and
must wait until other more needful things are done. Well,
is it not clear that the same law holds good in every
community? Is it not true of the latter phases of social
evolution, as of the earlier, that when things are let alone
the smaller desiderata will be postponed to the greater.</p>

<p>Hence, then, the justification of the seeming paradox, that
until spontaneously fulfilled a public want should not be fulfilled
at all. It must, on the average, result in our complex
state, as in simpler ones, that the thing left undone is a
thing by doing which citizens cannot gain so much as by
doing other things—is therefore a thing which society does
not want done so much as it wants these other things done;
and the corollary is, that to effect a neglected thing by
artificially employing citizens to do it, is to leave undone
some more important thing which they would have been
doing—is to sacrifice the greater requisite to the smaller.</p>

<p>“But,” it will perhaps be objected, “if the things done
by a government, or at least by a rep­re­sen­ta­tive government,
are also done in obedience to some aggregate desire,
why may we not look for this normal subordination of the
more needful to the less needful in them too?” The reply
is, that though they have a certain tendency to follow this
order—though those primal desires for public defence and
personal protection, out of which government originates,
were satisfied through its instrumentality in proper succession—though,
possibly, some other early and simple requirements
may have been so too; yet, when the desires are not
few, universal and intense, but, like those remaining to be
satisfied in the latter stages of civilization, numerous,
partial, and moderate, the judgment of a government is no
longer to be trusted. To select out of an immense number
of minor wants, physical, intellectual, and moral, felt in
different degrees by different classes, and by a total mass
varying in every case, the want that is most pressing, is a
task which no legislature can accomplish. No
man or men <span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
by inspecting society can <i>see</i> what it most needs; society
must be left to <i>feel</i> what it most needs. The mode of solution
must be experimental, not theoretical. When left, day
after day, to experience evils and dissatisfactions of various
kinds, affecting them in various degrees, citizens gradually
acquire repugnance to these proportionate to their greatness,
and corresponding desires to get rid of them, which
by spontaneously fostering remedial agencies are likely to
end in the worst inconvenience being first removed. And
however irregular this process may be (and we admit that
men’s habits and prejudices produce many anomalies, or
seeming anomalies, in it) it is a process far more trustworthy
than are legislative judgments. For those who question
this there are instances; and, that the parallel may be the
more conclusive, we will take a case in which the ruling
power is deemed specially fit to decide. We refer to our
means of communication.</p>

<p>Do those who maintain that railways would have been
better laid out and constructed by government, hold that
the order of importance would have been as uniformly
followed as it has been by private enterprise? Under the
stimulus of an enormous traffic—a traffic too great for the
then existing means—the first line sprung up between
Liverpool and Manchester. Next came the Grand Junction
and the London and Birmingham (now merged in the
London and North Western); afterwards the Great
Western, the South Western, the South Eastern, the
Eastern Counties, the Midland. Since then subsidiary
lines and branches have occupied our capitalists. As they
were quite certain to do, companies made first the most
needed, and therefore the best paying, lines; under the
same impulse that a labourer chooses high wages in preference
to low. That government would have adopted
a better order can hardly be, for the best has been
followed; but that it would have adopted a worse, all the
evidence we have goes to show. In
default of materials <span class="xxpn" id="p267">{267}</span>
for a direct parallel, we might cite from India and the
colonies, cases of injudicious road-making. Or, as exemplifying
State-efforts to facilitate communication, we might
dwell on the fact that while our rulers have sacrificed
hundreds of lives and spent untold treasure in seeking a
North-west passage, which would be useless if found, they
have left the exploration of the Isthmus of Panama, and
the making railways and canals through it, to private companies.
But, not to make much of this indirect evidence,
we will content ourselves with the one sample of a State-made
channel for commerce, which we have at home—the
Caledonian Canal. Up to the present time (1853), this
public work has cost upwards of 1,100,000<i>l.</i> It has now
been open for many years, and salaried emissaries have been
constantly employed to get traffic for it. The results, as
given in its forty-seventh annual report, issued in 1852, are—receipts
during the year, 7,909<i>l.</i>; expenditure ditto,
9,261<i>l.</i>—loss, 1,352<i>l.</i> Has any such large investment been
made with such a pitiful result by a private canal company?</p>

<p>And if a government is so bad a judge of the relative importance
of social requirements, when these requirements
are <i>of the same kind</i>, how worthless a judge must it be when
they are of different kinds. If, where a fair share of
intelligence might be expected to lead them right, legislators
and their officers go so wrong, how terribly will they
err where no amount of intelligence would suffice them,—where
they must decide among hosts of needs, bodily,
intellectual, and moral, which admit of no direct comparisons;
and how disastrous must be the results if they
act out their erroneous decisions. Should any one need
this bringing home to him by an illustration, let him read
the following extract from the last of the series of letters
some time since published in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, on
the state of agriculture in France. After expressing the
opinion that French farming is some century behind English
farming, the writer goes on to say:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“There are two causes principally chargeable with this.
In the first <span class="xxpn" id="p268">{268}</span>
place, strange as it may seem in a country in which two-thirds of the population
are agriculturists, agriculture is a very unhonoured occupation. Develope
in the slightest degree a Frenchman’s mental faculties, and he flies to a town
as surely as steel filings fly to a loadstone. He has no rural tastes, no delight
in rural habits. A French amateur farmer would indeed be a sight to see.
Again, this national tendency is directly encouraged by the centralising
system of government—by the multitude of officials, and by the payment of
all functionaries. From all parts of France, men of great energy and resource
struggle up, and fling themselves on the world of Paris. There they try to
become great functionaries. Through every department of the eighty-four,
men of less energy and resource struggle up to the <i>chef-lieu</i>—the provincial
capital. There they try to become little functionaries. Go still lower—deal
with a still smaller scale—and the result will be the same. As is the department
to France, so is the arrondissement to the department, and the commune
to the arrondissement. All who have, or think they have, heads on their
shoulders, struggle into towns to fight for office. All who are, or are deemed
by themselves or others, too stupid for anything else, are left at home to till
the fields, and breed the cattle, and prune the vines, as their ancestors did
for generations before them. Thus there is actually no intelligence left in
the country. The whole energy, and knowledge, and resource of the land
are barreled up in the towns. You leave one city, and in many cases you
will not meet an educated or cultivated individual until you arrive at
another—all between is utter intellectual barrenness.”—<i>Morning Chronicle.</i>
August, 1851.</p></blockquote>

<p>To what end now is this constant abstraction of able men
from rural districts? To the end that there may be enough
functionaries to achieve those many desiderata which French
governments have thought ought to be achieved—to provide
amusements, to manage mines, to construct roads and
bridges, to erect numerous buildings—to print books,
encourage the fine arts, control this trade, and inspect
that manufacture—to do all the hundred-and-one things
which the State does in France. That the army of officers
needed for this may be maintained, agriculture must go
unofficered. That certain social conveniences may be
better secured, the chief social necessity is neglected. The
very basis of the national life is sapped, to gain a few non-essential
advantages. Said we not truly, then, that until
a requirement is spontaneously fulfilled, it should not be
fulfilled at all?</p>

<p class="padtopb">And here indeed we may recognise
the close kinship <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span>
between the fundamental fallacy involved in these State-meddlings
and the fallacy lately exploded by the free-trade
agitation. These various law-made in­stru­men­tal­i­ties for
effecting ends which might otherwise not yet be effected, all
embody a subtler form of the protectionist hypothesis. The
same short-sightedness which, looking at commerce, prescribed
bounties and restrictions, looking at social affairs in
general, prescribes these multiplied ad­min­i­stra­tions; and
the same criticism applies alike to all its proceedings.</p>

<p>For was not the error that vitiated every law aiming at
the artificial maintenance of a trade, substantially that
which we have just been dwelling upon; namely, this
overlooking of the fact that, in setting people to do one
thing, some other thing is inevitably left undone? The
statesmen who thought it wise to protect home-made silks
against French silks, did so under the impression that the
manufacture thus secured constituted a pure gain to the
nation. They did not reflect that the men employed in this
manufacture would otherwise have been producing something
else—a something else which, as they could produce
it without legal help, they could more profitably produce.
Landlords who have been so anxious to prevent foreign
wheat from displacing their own wheat, have never duly
realized the fact that if their fields would not yield wheat
so economically as to prevent the feared displacement, it
simply proved that they were growing unfit crops in place
of fit crops; and so working their land at a relative loss.
In all cases where, by restrictive duties, a trade has been
upheld that would otherwise not have existed, capital has
been turned into a channel less productive than some other
into which it would naturally have flowed. And so, to
pursue certain State-patronized occupations, men have been
drawn from more advantageous occupations.</p>

<p>Clearly then, as above alleged, the same oversight runs
through all these interferences; be they with commerce, or
be they with other things. In employing
people to achieve <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span>
this or that desideratum, legislators have not perceived
that they were thereby preventing the achievement of some
other desideratum. They have habitually assumed that
each proposed good would, if secured, be a pure good, instead
of being a good purchasable only by submission to some
evil which would else have been remedied; and, making
this error, have injuriously diverted men’s labour. As in
trade, so in other things, labour will spontaneously find
out, better than any government can find out for it, the
things on which it may best expend itself. Rightly regarded,
the two propositions are identical. This division
into commercial and non-commercial affairs is quite a superficial
one. All the actions going on in society come under
the generalization—human effort ministering to human
desire. Whether the ministration be effected through a
process of buying and selling, or whether in any other way,
matters not so far as the general law of it is concerned.
In all cases it must be true that the stronger desires will
get themselves satisfied before the weaker ones; and in all
cases it must be true that to get satisfaction for the weaker
ones before they would naturally have it, is to deny satisfaction
to the stronger ones.</p>

<p class="padtopb">To the immense positive evils entailed by over-legislation
have to be added the equally great negative evils—evils
which, notwithstanding their greatness, are scarcely at all
recognized, even by the far-seeing. While the State does
those things which it ought not to do, <i>as an inevitable
consequence</i>, it leaves undone those things which it ought
to do. Time and activity being limited, it necessarily
follows that legislators’ sins of <i>commission</i> entail sins of
<i>omission</i>. Mischievous meddling involves disastrous neglect;
and until statesmen are ubiquitous and omnipotent, must
ever do so. In the very nature of things an agency
employed for two purposes must fulfil both imperfectly;
partly because, while fulfilling the one it
cannot be fulfilling <span class="xxpn" id="p271">{271}</span>
the other, and partly because its adaptation to both ends
implies incomplete fitness for either. As has been well
said <i>à propos</i> of this point,—“A blade which is designed
both to shave and to carve, will certainly not shave so well
as a razor or carve so well as a carving-knife. An academy
of painting, which should also be a bank, would in all
probability exhibit very bad pictures and discount very bad
bills. A gas company, which should also be an infant-school
society, would, we apprehend, light the streets ill,
and teach the children ill.”<a class="afnanch" href="#fn34" id="fnanch34">34</a>
And if an institution undertakes,
not two functions but a score—if a government,
whose office it is to defend citizens against aggressors,
foreign and domestic, engages also to disseminate Christianity,
to administer charity, to teach children their lessons,
to adjust prices of food, to inspect coal-mines, to regulate
railways, to superintend house-building, to arrange cab-fares,
to look into people’s stink-traps, to vaccinate their
children, to send out emigrants, to prescribe hours of labour,
to examine lodging-houses, to test the knowledge of
mercantile captains, to provide public libraries, to read and
authorize dramas, to inspect passenger-ships, to see that
small dwellings are supplied with water, to regulate endless
things from a banker’s issues down to the boat-fares on the
Serpentine—is it not manifest that its primary duty must be
ill-discharged in proportion to the multiplicity of affairs it
busies itself with? Must not its time and energies be frittered
away in schemes, and inquiries, and amendments, in discussions,
and divisions, to the neglect of its essential business?
And does not a glance over the debates make it clear that
this is the fact? and that, while parliament and public
are alike occupied with these mischievous interferences, these
Utopian hopes, the one thing needful is left almost undone?</p>

<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, April, 1839.</p></div>

<p>See here, then, the proximate cause of our legal abominations.
We drop the substance in our efforts to catch
shadows. While our firesides, and
clubs, and taverns are <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span>
filled with talk about corn-law questions, and church
questions, and education questions, and poor-law questions—all
of them raised by over-legislation—the justice question
gets scarcely any attention; and we daily submit to be
oppressed, cheated, robbed. This institution which should
succour the man who has fallen among thieves, turns him
over to solicitors, barristers, and a legion of law-officers;
drains his purse for writs, briefs, affidavits, subpœnas, fees
of all kinds and expenses innumerable; involves him in
the intricacies of common courts, chancery courts, suits,
counter-suits, and appeals; and often ruins where it should
aid. Meanwhile, meetings are called, and leading articles
written, and votes asked, and societies formed, and agitations
carried on, not to rectify these gigantic evils, but
partly to abolish our ancestors’ mischievous meddlings and
partly to establish meddlings of our own. Is it not obvious
that this fatal neglect is a result of this mistaken officiousness?
Suppose that external and internal protection had
been the sole recognized functions of the ruling powers.
Is it conceivable that our ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice would
have been as corrupt as now? Can any one believe that
had parliamentary elections been habitually contested on
questions of legal reform, our judicial system would still have
been what Sir John Romilly calls it,—“a technical system
invented for the creation of costs?” Does any one suppose
that, if the efficient defence of person and property had
been the constant subject-matter of hustings pledges, we
should yet be waylaid by a Chancery Court which has now
more than two hundred millions of property in its clutches?—which
keeps suits pending fifty years, until all the funds
are gone in fees—which swallows in costs two millions
annually? Dare any one assert that had con­stit­uen­cies
been always canvassed on principles of law-reform versus
law-conservatism, Ecclesiastical Courts would have continued
for centuries fattening on the goods of widows and
orphans? The questions are next to absurd.
A child may <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
see that with the general knowledge people have of legal
corruptions and the universal detestation of legal atrocities,
an end would long since have been put to them, had the
ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice always been <i>the</i> political topic.
Had not the public mind been constantly pre-occupied, it
could never have been tolerated that a man neglecting to
file an answer to a bill in due course, should be imprisoned
fifteen years for contempt of court, as Mr. James Taylor was.
It would have been impossible that, on the abolition of their
sinecures, the sworn-clerks should have been compensated
by the continuance of their exorbitant incomes, not only
till death, but for seven years after, at a total estimated
cost of £700,000. Were the State confined to its
defensive and judicial functions, not only the people but
legislators themselves would agitate against abuses. The
sphere of activity and the opportunities for distinction
being narrowed, all the thought, and industry, and
eloquence which members of Parliament now expend on
impracticable schemes and artificial grievances, would be
expended in rendering justice pure, certain, prompt, and
cheap. The complicated follies of our legal verbiage, which
the uninitiated cannot understand and which the initiated
interpret in various senses, would be quickly put an end
to. We should no longer frequently hear of Acts of
Parliament so bunglingly drawn up that it requires half a
dozen actions and judges’ decisions under them, before
even lawyers can say how they apply. There would be no
such stupidly-designed measures as the Railway Winding-up
Act, which, though passed in 1846 to close the accounts
of the bubble schemes of the mania, leaves them still
unsettled in 1854—which, even with funds in hand, withholds
payment from creditors whose claims have been years
since admitted. Lawyers would no longer be suffered to
maintain and to complicate the present absurd system of
land titles, which, besides the litigation and loss it perpetually
causes, lowers the value of
estates, prevents the <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span>
ready application of capital to them, checks the development
of agriculture, and thus hinders the improvement of
the peasantry and the prosperity of the country. In short,
the corruptions, follies, and terrors of law would cease;
and that which men now shrink from as an enemy they
would come to regard as what it purports to be—a
friend.</p>

<p>How vast then is the negative evil which, in addition to
the positive evils before enumerated, this meddling policy
entails on us! How many are the grievances men bear,
from which they would otherwise be free! Who is there
that has not submitted to injuries rather than run the risk
of heavy law-costs? Who is there that has not abandoned
just claims rather than “throw good money after bad?”
Who is there that has not paid unjust demands rather than
withstand the threat of an action? This man can point to
property that has been alienated from his family from
lack of funds or courage to fight for it. That man can
name several relations ruined by a law-suit. Here is a
lawyer who has grown rich on the hard earnings of the
needy and the savings of the oppressed. There is a once
wealthy trader who has been brought by legal iniquities to
the workhouse or the lunatic asylum. The badness of our
judicial system vitiates our whole social life: renders
almost every family poorer than it would otherwise be;
hampers almost every business transaction; inflicts daily
anxieties on every trader. And all this loss of property,
time, temper, comfort, men quietly submit to from being
absorbed in the pursuit of schemes which eventually bring
on them other mischiefs.</p>

<p>Nay, the case is even worse. It is distinctly proveable
that many of these evils about which outcries are raised,
and to cure which special Acts of Parliament are loudly
invoked, are themselves <i>produced</i> by our disgraceful judicial
system. For example, it is well known that the horrors
out of which our sanitary agitators
make political capital, <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
are found in their greatest intensity on properties that
have been for a generation in Chancery—are distinctly
traceable to the ruin thus brought about; and would never
have existed but for the infamous corruptions of law.
Again, it has been shown that the long-drawn miseries of
Ireland, which have been the subject of endless legislation,
have been mainly produced by inequitable land-tenure and
the complicated system of entail: a system which wrought
such involvements as to prevent sales; which practically
negatived all improvement; which brought landlords to the
workhouse; and which required an Incumbered Estates Act
to cut its gordian knots and render the proper cultivation
of the soil possible. Judicial negligence, too, is the main
cause of railway accidents. If the State would fulfil its
true function, by giving passengers an easy remedy for
breach of contract when trains are behind time, it would
do more to prevent accidents than can be done by the
minutest inspection or the most cunningly-devised regulations;
for it is notorious that the majority of accidents
are primarily caused by irregularity. In the case of bad
house-building, also, it is obvious that a cheap, rigorous,
and certain ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice, would make Building
Acts needless. For is not the man who erects a house of
bad materials ill put together, and, concealing these with
papering and plaster, sells it as a substantial dwelling,
guilty of fraud? And should not the law recognize this
fraud as it does in the analogous case of an unsound horse?
And if the legal remedy were easy, prompt, and sure, would
not builders cease transgressing? So is it in other cases:
the evils which men perpetually call on the State to cure
by superintendence, themselves arise from non-performance
of its original duty.</p>

<p>See then how this vicious policy complicates itself. Not
only does meddling legislation fail to cure the evils it aims
at; not only does it make many evils worse; not only does
it create new evils greater than the old;
but while doing <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
this it entails on men the oppressions, robberies, ruin, which
flow from the non-ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice. And not only
to the positive evils does it add this vast negative one, but
this again, by fostering many social abuses that would not
else exist, furnishes occasions for more meddlings which
again act and re-act in the same way. And thus as ever,
“things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.”</p>

<p class="padtopb">After assigning reasons thus fundamental, for condemning
all State-action save that which universal experience has
proved to be absolutely needful, it would seem superfluous
to assign subordinate ones. Were it called for, we might,
taking for text Mr. Lindsay’s work on “Navigation and
Mercantile Marine Law,” say much upon the complexity
to which this process of adding regulation to regulation—each
necessitated by foregoing ones—ultimately leads: a
complexity which, by the mis­un­der­stand­ings, delays, and
disputes it entails, greatly hampers our social life. Something,
too, might be added upon the perturbing effects of
that “gross delusion,” as M. Guizot calls it, “a belief in
the sovereign power of political machinery”—a delusion to
which he partly ascribes the late revolution in France; and
a delusion which is fostered by every new interference.
But, passing over these, we would dwell for a short space
upon the national enervation which this State-superintendence
produces.</p>

<p>The enthusiastic philanthropist, urgent for some act of
parliament to remedy this evil or secure the other good,
thinks it a trivial and far-fetched objection that the people
will be morally injured by doing things for them instead of
leaving them to do things themselves. He vividly conceives
the benefit he hopes to get achieved, which is a positive and
readily imaginable thing. He does not conceive the diffused,
invisible, and slowly-accumulating effect wrought on the
popular mind, and so does not believe in it; or, if he admits
it, thinks it beneath consideration.
Would he but <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span>
remember, however, that all national character is gradually
produced by the daily action of circumstances, of which
each day’s result seems so insignificant as not to be worth
mentioning, he would perceive that what is trifling when
viewed in its increments may be formidable when viewed in
its total. Or if he would go into the nursery, and watch
how repeated actions—each of them apparently unimportant,—create,
in the end, a habit which will affect the
whole future life; he would be reminded that every
influence brought to bear on human nature tells, and, if
continued, tells seriously. The thoughtless mother who
hourly yields to the requests—“Mamma, tie my pinafore,”
“Mamma, button my shoe,” and the like, cannot be persuaded
that each of these concessions is detrimental; but
the wiser spectator sees that if this policy be long pursued,
and be extended to other things, it will end in inaptitude.
The teacher of the old school who showed his pupil the way
out of every difficulty, did not perceive that he was generating
an attitude of mind greatly militating against success
in life. The modern teacher, however, induces his pupil to
solve his difficulties himself; believes that in so doing he is
preparing him to meet the difficulties which, when he goes
into the world, there will be no one to help him through;
and finds confirmation for this belief in the fact that a great
proportion of the most successful men are self-made. Well,
is it not obvious that this relationship between discipline
and success holds good nationally? Are not nations made
of men; and are not men subject to the same laws of
modification in their adult years as in their early years?
Is it not true of the drunkard, that each carouse adds a
thread to his bonds? of the trader, that each acquisition
strengthens the wish for acquisitions? of the pauper, that
the more you assist him the more he wants? of the busy
man, that the more he has to do the more he can do? And
does it not follow that if every individual is subject to this
process of adaptation to conditions, a whole
nation must be <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span>
so—that just in proportion as its members are little helped
by extraneous power they will become self-helping, and in
proportion as they are much helped they will become helpless?
What folly is it to ignore these results because
they are not direct, and not immediately visible. Though
slowly wrought out they are inevitable. We can no more
elude the laws of human development than we can elude
the law of gravitation; and so long as they hold true must
these effects occur.</p>

<p>If we are asked in what special directions this alleged
helplessness, entailed by much State-superintendence,
shows itself; we reply that it is seen in a retardation of all
social growths requiring self-confidence in the people—in a
timidity that fears all difficulties not before encountered—in
a thoughtless contentment with things as they are. Let
any one, after duly watching the rapid evolution going on
in England, where men have been comparatively little
helped by governments—or better still, after contemplating
the unparalleled progress of the United States, which is
peopled by self-made men, and the recent descendants of
self-made men;—let such an one, we say, go on to the
Continent, and consider the relatively slow advance which
things are there making; and the still slower advance they
would make but for English enterprise. Let him go to
Holland, and see that though the Dutch early showed themselves
good mechanics, and have had abundant practice in
hydraulics, Amsterdam has been without any due supply of
water until now that works are being established by an
English company. Let him go to Berlin, and there be told
that, to give that city a water-supply such as London has had
for generations, the project of an English firm is about to be
executed by English capital, under English superintendence.
Let him go to Vienna, and learn that it, in common with
other continental cities, is lighted by an English gas-company.
Let him go on the Rhone, on the Loire, on the
Danube, and discover that
Englishmen established steam <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
navigation on those rivers. Let him inquire concerning
the railways in Italy, Spain, France, Sweden, Denmark,
how many of them are English projects, how many
have been largely helped by English capital, how many
have been executed by English contractors, how many
have had English engineers. Let him discover, too, as he
will, that where railways have been government-made, as
in Russia, the energy, the perseverance, and the practical
talent developed in England and the United States have
been called in to aid. And then if these illustrations of the
progressiveness of a self-dependent race, and the torpidity
of paternally-governed ones, do not suffice him, he may
read Mr. Laing’s successive volumes of European travel,
and there study the contrast in detail. What, now, is the
cause of this contrast? In the order of nature, a capacity
for self-help must in every case have been brought into
existence by the practice of self-help; and, other things
equal, a lack of this capacity must in every case have
arisen from the lack of demand for it. Do not these two
antecedents and their two consequents agree with the facts
as presented in England and Europe? Were not the
inhabitants of the two, some centuries ago, much upon a
par in point of enterprise? Were not the English even
behind in their manufactures, in their colonization, in their
commerce? Has not the immense relative change the
English have undergone in this respect, been coincident
with the great relative self-dependence they have been
since habituated to? And has not the one been caused by
the other? Whoever doubts it, is asked to assign a more
probable cause. Whoever admits it, must admit that the
enervation of a people by perpetual State-aids is not a
trifling consideration, but the most weighty consideration.
A general arrest of national growth he will see to be an
evil greater than any special benefits can compensate for.
And, indeed, when, after contemplating this great fact, the
overspreading of the Earth by the English,
he remarks the <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
absence of any parallel achievement by a continental race—when
he reflects how this difference must depend chiefly on
difference of character, and how such difference of character
has been mainly produced by difference of discipline; he
will perceive that the policy pursued in this matter may
have a large share in determining a nation’s ultimate fate.</p>

<p class="padtopb">We are not sanguine, however, that argument will
change the convictions of those who put their trust in
legislation. With men of a certain order of thought the
foregoing reasons will have weight. With men of another
order of thought they will have little or none; nor would
any accumulation of such reasons affect them. The truth
that experience teaches, has its limits. The experiences
which teach, must be experiences which can be appreciated;
and experiences exceeding a certain degree of complexity
become inappreciable to the majority. It is thus with most
social phenomena. If we remember that for these two
thousand years and more, mankind have been making
regulations for commerce, which have all along been
strangling some trades and killing others with kindness,
and that though the proofs of this have been constantly
before their eyes, they have only just discovered that they
have been uniformly doing mischief—if we remember that
even now only a small portion of them see this; we are
taught that perpetually-repeated and ever-accumulating
experiences will fail to teach, until there exist the mental
conditions required for the assimilation of them. Nay,
when they are assimilated, it is very imperfectly. The
truth they teach is only half understood, even by those
supposed to understand it best. For example, Sir Robert
Peel, in one of his last speeches, after describing the
immensely increased consumption consequent on free trade,
goes on to say:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“If, then, you can only continue that consumption—if,
<i>by your legislation</i>, under the favour of Providence,
<i>you can maintain the demand for labour and make your
trade and manufactures prosperous</i>, you are not only
increasing the <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span> sum of human happiness, but are
giving the agriculturists of this country the best chance
of that increased demand which must contribute to their
welfare.”—<i>Times</i>, Feb. 22, 1850.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus the prosperity really due to the abandonment of all
legislation, is ascribed to a particular kind of legislation.
“<i>You</i> can maintain the demand,” he says; “<i>you</i> can make
trade and manufactures prosperous;” whereas, the facts
he quotes prove that they can do this only by doing
nothing. The essential truth of the matter—that law had
been doing immense harm, and that this prosperity resulted
not from law but from the absence of law—is missed; and
his faith in legislation in general, which should, by this
experience, have been greatly shaken, seemingly remains
as strong as ever. Here, again, is the House of Lords,
apparently not yet believing in the relationship of supply
and demand, adopting within these few weeks the
standing order―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“That before the first reading of any bill for making any work in the
construction of which compulsory power is sought to take thirty houses or
more inhabited by the labouring classes in any one parish or place, the
promoters be required to deposit in the office of the clerk of the parliaments
a statement of the number, description, and situation of the said houses, the
number (so far as they can be estimated) of persons to be displaced, <i>and
whether any and what provision is made in the bill for remedying the inconvenience
likely to arise from such displacements</i>.”</p></blockquote>

<p>If, then, in the comparatively simple relationships of
trade, the teachings of experience remain for so many ages
unperceived, and are so imperfectly apprehended when they
are perceived, it is scarcely to be hoped that where all social
phenomena—moral, intellectual, and physical—are involved,
any due appreciation of the truths displayed will presently
take place. The facts cannot yet get recognized as facts.
As the alchemist attributed his successive disappointments
to some disproportion in the ingredients, some impurity, or
some too great temperature, and never to the futility of his
process or the impossibility of his aim; so, every failure of
State-regulations the law-worshipper explains away as
being caused by this trifling oversight,
or that little <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
mistake: all which oversights and mistakes he assures
you will in future be avoided. Eluding the facts as he
does after this fashion, volley after volley of them produce
no effect.</p>

<p>Indeed this faith in governments is in a certain sense
organic; and can diminish only by being outgrown. From
the time when rulers were thought demi-gods, there has
been a gradual decline in men’s estimates of their power.
This decline is still in progress, and has still far to go.
Doubtless, every increment of evidence furthers it in <i>some</i>
degree, though not to the degree that at first appears.
Only in so far as it modifies character does it produce a
permanent effect. For while the mental type remains the
same, the removal of a special error is inevitably followed
by the growth of other errors of the same genus. All
superstitions die hard; and we fear that this belief in
government-omnipotence will
form no exception.</p>

<h2 class="h2nobreak">REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT—WHAT IS IT
GOOD FOR?</h2></div>

<p class="pfirst">[<i>First published in </i>The Westminster

<p>Shakspeare’s simile for adversity―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight"><div class="nowrap">
<p class="pfirst">Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</p>
<p class="pcontinue">Wears yet a precious jewel in his head,</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">might fitly be used also as a simile for a disagreeable
truth. Repulsive as is its aspect, the hard fact which
dissipates a cherished illusion, is presently found to contain
the germ of a more salutary belief. The experience of
every one furnishes instances in which an opinion long
shrunk from as seemingly at variance with all that is good,
but finally accepted as irresistible, turns out to be fraught
with benefits. It is thus with self-knowledge: much as
we dislike to admit our defects, we find it better to know
and guard against than to ignore them. It is thus with
changes of creed: alarming as looks the reasoning by
which superstitions are overthrown, the convictions to
which it leads prove to be healthier ones than those they
superseded. And it is thus with political enlightenment:
men eventually see cause to thank those who pull to pieces
their political air-castles, hateful as they once seemed.
Moreover, not only is it always better to believe truth
than error; but the repugnant-looking facts are ever found
to be parts of something far better than the
ideal which they <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
dispelled. To the many illustrations of this which might
be cited, we shall presently add another.</p>

<p class="padtopb">It is a conviction almost universally entertained here in
England, that our method of making and administering
laws possesses every virtue. Prince Albert’s unlucky
saying that “Representative Government is on its trial,” is
vehemently repudiated: we consider that the trial has
long since ended in our favour on all the counts. Partly
from ignorance, partly from the bias of education, partly
from that patriotism which leads the men of each nation to
pride themselves in their own institutions, we have an
unhesitating belief in the entire superiority of our form of
political organization. Yet unfriendly critics can point
out vices that are manifestly inherent. And if we may
believe the defenders of despotism, these vices are fatal to
its efficiency.</p>

<p>Now instead of denying or blinking these allegations, it
would be wiser candidly to inquire whether they are true;
and if true, what they imply. If, as most of us are so
confident, government by rep­re­sen­ta­tives is better than
any other, we can afford to listen patiently to all adverse
remarks: believing that they are either invalid, or that
if valid they do not essentially tell against its merits. If
our political system is well founded, this crucial criticism
will serve but to bring out its worth more clearly than
ever; and to give us higher conceptions of its nature, its
meaning, its purpose. Let us, then, banishing for the
nonce all prepossessions, and taking up a thoroughly
antagonistic point of view, set down without mitigation its
many flaws, vices, and absurdities.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Is it not manifest that a ruling body made up of many
individuals, who differ in character, education, and aims,
who belong to classes having antagonistic ideas and
feelings, and who are severally swayed
by the special <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
opinions of the districts deputing them, must be a cumbrous
apparatus for the management of public affairs? When
we devise a machine we take care that its parts are as
few as possible; that they are adapted to their respective
ends; that they are properly joined with one another;
and that they work smoothly to their common purpose.
Our political machine, however, is constructed upon directly
opposite principles. Its parts are extremely numerous:
multiplied, indeed, beyond all reason. They are not
severally chosen as specially qualified for particular functions.
No care is taken that they shall fit well together:
on the contrary, our arrangements are such that they
are certain not to fit. And that, as a consequence, they do
not and cannot act in harmony, is a fact nightly demonstrated
to all the world. In truth, had the problem been
to find an appliance for the slow and bungling transaction
of business, it could scarcely have been better solved.
Immense hindrance results from the mere multiplicity of
parts; a further immense hindrance results from their
incongruity; yet another immense hindrance results from
the frequency with which they are changed; while the
greatest hindrance of all results from the want of subordination
of the parts to their functions—from the fact that
the personal welfare of the legislator is not bound up with
the efficient performance of his political duty.</p>

<p>These defects are inherent in the very nature of our
institutions; and they cannot fail to produce disastrous
mismanagement. If proofs be needed, they may be
furnished in abundance, both from the current history of
our central rep­re­sen­ta­tive government, and from that of
local ones, public and private. Let us, before going on to
contemplate these evils as displayed on a great scale in our
legislature, glance at some of them in their simpler and
smaller manifestations.</p>

<p>We will not dwell on the com­par­a­tive in­ef­ficiency of
deputed ad­min­i­stra­tion in
mercantile affairs. The <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
un­trust­worth­i­ness of directorial management might be afresh
illustrated by the recent joint-stock-bank catastrophies:
the reck­less­ness and dishonesty of rulers whose interests
are not one with those of the concern they control, being
in these cases conspicuously displayed. Or we could enlarge
on the same truth as exhibited in the doings of railway-boards:
instancing the malversations proved against their
members; the carelessness which has permitted Robson
and Redpath frauds; the rashness perseveringly shown in
making unprofitable branches and extensions. But facts of
this kind are sufficiently familiar.</p>

<p>Let us pass, then, to less notorious examples. Mechanics’
Institutions will supply our first. The theory of these is
plausible enough. Artizans wanting knowledge, and benevolent
middle-class people wishing to help them to it,
constitute the raw material. By uniting their means they
propose to obtain literary and other advantages, which else
would be beyond their reach. And it is concluded that,
being all interested in securing the proposed objects, and
the governing body being chosen out of their number, the
results cannot fail to be such as were intended. In most
cases, however, the results are quite otherwise. Indifference,
stupidity, party-spirit, and religious dissension, nearly
always thwart the efforts of the promoters. It is thought
good policy to select as president some local notability;
probably not distinguished for wisdom, but whose donation
or prestige more than counterbalances his defect in this
respect. Vice-presidents are chosen with the same view:
a clergyman or two; some neighbouring squires, if they
can be had; an ex-mayor; several aldermen; half a dozen
manufacturers and wealthy tradesmen; and a miscellaneous
complement. While the committee, mostly elected more
because of their position or popularity than their intelligence
or fitness for co-operation, exhibit similar incongruities.
Causes of dissension quickly arise. A book much wished
for by the mass of the members,
is tabooed, because <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
ordering it would offend the clerical party in the institution.
Regard for the prejudices of certain magistrates and squires
who figure among the vice-presidents, forbids the engagement
of an otherwise desirable and popular lecturer, whose
political and religious opinions are somewhat extreme.
The selection of newspapers and magazines for the reading-room,
is a fruitful source of disputes. Should some, thinking
it would be a great boon to those for whom the institution
was established, propose to open the reading-room on
Sundays, there arises a violent fight; ending, perhaps, in
the secession of some of the defeated party. The question
of amusements, again, furnishes a bone of contention. Shall
the institution exist solely for instruction, or shall it add
gratification? The refreshment-question, also, is apt to be
raised, and to add to the other causes of difference. In
short, the stupidity, prejudice, party-spirit, and squabbling,
are such as eventually to drive away in disgust those who
should have been the administrators; and to leave the
control in the hands of a clique, who pursue some humdrum
middle course, satisfying nobody. Instead of that prosperity
which would probably have been achieved under the
direction of one good man-of-business, whose welfare was
bound up with its success, the institution loses its prestige,
and dwindles away: ceases almost entirely to be what was
intended—a <i>mechanics</i>’ institution; and becomes little more
than a middle-class lounge, kept up not so much by the
permanent adhesion of its members, as by the continual
addition of new ones in place of the old ones constantly
falling off. Meanwhile, the end originally proposed is
fulfilled, so far as it gets fulfilled at all, by private enterprise.
Cheap newspapers and cheap periodicals, provided
by publishers having in view the pockets and tastes of the
working-classes; coffee-shops and penny reading-rooms,
set up by men whose aim is profit; are the instruments of
the chief proportion of such culture as is going on.</p>

<p>In higher-class institutions of the
same order—in Literary <span class="xxpn" id="p288">{288}</span>
Societies and Philosophical Societies, etc.—the like inefficiency
of rep­re­sen­ta­tive government is generally displayed.
Quickly following the vigour of early enthusiasm, come
class and sectarian differences, the final supremacy of a
party, bad management, apathy. Subscribers complain they
cannot get what they want; and one by one desert to
private book-clubs or to Mudie.</p>

<p>Turning from non-political to political institutions, we
might, had we space, draw illustrations from the doings of
the old poor-law authorities, or from those of modern boards
of guardians; but omitting these and others such, we will,
among local governments, confine ourselves to the reformed
municipal corporations.</p>

<p>If, leaving out of sight all other evidences, and forgetting
that they are newly-organized bodies into which corruption
has scarcely had time to creep, we were to judge of these
municipal corporations by the town-improvements they have
effected, we might pronounce them successful. But, even
without insisting on the fact that such improvements are
more due to the removal of obstructions, and to that same
progressive spirit which has established railways and telegraphs,
than to the positive virtues of these civic governments;
it is to be remarked that the execution of numerous
public works is by no means an adequate test. With power
of raising funds limited only by a rebellion of ratepayers,
it is easy in prosperous, increasing towns, to make a display
of efficiency. The proper questions to be asked are:—Do
municipal elections end in the choice of the fittest men who
are to be found? Does the resulting administrative body,
perform well and economically the work which devolves on
it? And does it show sound judgment in refraining from
needless or improper work? To these questions the answers
are by no means satisfactory.</p>

<p>Town-councils are not conspicuous for either intelligence
or high character. There are competent judges who think
that, on the average, their members are inferior
to those of <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
the old corporations they superseded. As all the world
knows, the elections turn mainly on political opinions. The
first question respecting any candidate is, not whether he
has great knowledge, judgment, or business-faculty—not
whether he has any special aptitude for the duty to be discharged;
but whether he is Whig or Tory. Even supposing
his politics to be unobjectionable, his nomination still does
not depend chiefly on his proved uprightness or capacity,
but much more on his friendly relations with the dominant
clique. A number of the town magnates, habitually meeting
probably at the chief hotel, and there held together as
much by the brotherhood of conviviality as by that of
opinion, discuss the merits of all whose names are before
the public, and decide which are the most suitable. This
gin-and-water caucus it is which practically determines the
choice of candidates; and, by consequence, the elections.
Those who will succumb to leadership—those who will
merge their private opinions in the policy of their party, of
course have the preference. Men too independent for this—too
far-seeing to join in the shibboleth of the hour, or too
refined to mix with the “jolly good fellows” who thus rule
the town, are shelved; notwithstanding that they are,
above all others, fitted for office. Partly from this underhand
influence, and partly from the consequent disgust
which leads them to decline standing if asked, the best
men are generally not in the governing body. It is
notorious that in London the most respectable merchants
will have nothing to do with the local government. And
in New York, “the exertions of its better citizens are still
exhausted in private accumulation, while the duties of
ad­min­i­stra­tion are left to other hands,” It cannot then be
asserted that in town-government, the rep­re­sen­ta­tive
system succeeds in bringing the ablest and most honourable
men to the top.</p>

<p>The efficient and economical discharge of duties is, of
course, hindered by this inferiority of
the deputies chosen; <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
and it is further hindered by the persistent action of party
and personal motives. Not whether he knows well how to
handle a level, but whether he voted for the popular candidate
at the last parliamentary election, is the question on
which may, and sometimes does, hang the choice of a town-surveyor;
and if sewers are ill laid out, it is a natural
consequence. When, a new public edifice having been
decided on, competition designs are advertised for; and
when the designs, ostensibly anonymous but really identifiable,
have been sent in; T. Square, Esq., who has an
influential relative in the corporation, makes sure of succeeding,
and is not disappointed: albeit his plans are not those
which would have been chosen by any one of the judges,
had the intended edifice been his own. Brown, who has
for many years been on the town-council and is one of the
dominant clique, has a son who is a doctor; and when, in
pursuance of an Act of Parliament, an officer of health
is to be appointed, Brown privately canvasses his fellow-councillors,
and succeeds in persuading them to elect his
son; though his son is by no means the fittest man the
place can furnish. Similarly with the choice of tradesmen
to execute work for the town. A public clock which is
frequently getting out of order, and Board-of-Health water-closets
which disgust those who have them (we state
facts), sufficiently testify that stupidity, favouritism, or
some sinister influence, is ever causing mismanagement.
The choice of inferior rep­re­sen­ta­tives, and by them of
inferior <i>employés</i>, joined with private interest and divided
responsibility, inevitably prevent the discharge of duties
from being satisfactory.</p>

<p>Moreover, the extravagance which is now becoming a
notorious vice of municipal bodies, is greatly increased by
the practice of undertaking things which they ought not to
undertake; and the incentive to do this is, in many cases,
traceable to the rep­re­sen­ta­tive origin of the body. The
system of compounding with
landlords for municipal <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span>
rates, leads the lower class of occupiers into the erroneous
belief that town-burdens do not fall in any degree on them;
and they therefore approve of an expenditure which seemingly
gives them gratis advantages while it creates employment.
As they form the mass of the constituency, lavishness
becomes a popular policy; and popularity-hunters vie with
one another in bringing forward new and expensive projects.
Here is a councillor who, having fears about his next
election, proposes an extensive scheme for public gardens—a
scheme which many who disapprove do not oppose, because
they, too, bear in mind the next election. There is another
councillor, who keeps a shop, and who raises and agitates
the question of baths and wash-houses; very well knowing
that his trade is not likely to suffer from such a course.
And so in other cases: the small direct interest which
each member of the corporation has in economical ad­min­i­stra­tion,
is antagonized by so many indirect interests of
other kinds, that he is not likely to be a good guardian
of the public purse.</p>

<p>Thus, neither in respect of the deputies chosen, nor the
efficient performance of their work, nor the avoidance of
unfit work, can the governments of our towns be held satisfactory.
And if in these recently-formed bodies the defects
are so conspicuous, still more conspicuous are they where
they have had time to grow to their full magnitude: witness
the case of New York. According to the <i>Times</i> correspondent
in that city, the New York people pay “over a
million and a half sterling, for which they have badly-paved
streets, a police by no means as efficient as it should be,
though much better than formerly, the greatest amount of
dirt north of Italy, the poorest cab-system of any metropolis
in the world, and only unsheltered wooden piers for the
discharge of merchandize.”</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now, having glanced at the general bearings of the
question in these minor cases, let us take the
major case of <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span>
our central government; and, in connexion with it, pursue
the inquiry more closely. Here the inherent faults of the
rep­re­sen­ta­tive system are much more clearly displayed.
The greater multiplicity of rulers involves greater cumbrousness,
greater confusion, greater delay. Differences of
class, of aims, of prejudices, are both larger in number and
wider in degree; and hence arise dissensions still more
multiplied. The direct effect which each legislator is likely
to experience from the working of any particular measure,
is usually very small and remote; while the indirect influences
which sway him are, in this above all other cases,
numerous and strong: whence follows a marked tendency
to neglect public welfare for private advantage. But let us
set out from the beginning—with the con­stit­uen­cies.</p>

<p>The rep­re­sen­ta­tive theory assumes that if a number of
citizens, deeply interested as they all are in good government,
are endowed with political power, they will choose the
wisest and best men for governors. Seeing how greatly
they suffer from bad ad­min­i­stra­tion of public affairs, it is
considered self-evident that they must have the <i>will</i>
to select proper rep­re­sen­ta­tives; and it is taken for
granted that average common sense gives the <i>ability</i> to
select proper rep­re­sen­ta­tives. How does experience bear
out these assumptions? Does it not to a great degree
negative them?</p>

<p>Several considerable classes of electors have little or no
<i>will</i> in the matter. Not a few of those on the register
pique themselves on taking no part in politics—claim credit
for having the sense not to meddle with things which they
say do not concern them. Many others there are whose
interest in the choice of a member of Parliament is so slight,
that they do not think it worth while to vote. A notable
proportion, too, shopkeepers especially, care so little about
the result, that their votes are determined by their wishes
to please their chief patrons or to avoid offending them.
In the minds of a yet larger class, small sums
of money, or <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span>
even <i>ad libitum</i> supplies of beer, outweigh any desires
they have to use their political powers independently.
Those who adequately recognize the importance of honestly
exercising their judgments in the selection of legislators,
and who give conscientious votes, form but a minority; and
the election usually hangs less upon their wills than upon
the illegitimate influences which sway the rest. Here,
therefore, the theory fails.</p>

<p>Then, again, as to intelligence. Even supposing that the
mass of electors have a sufficiently decided <i>will</i> to choose
the best rulers, what evidence have we of their <i>ability</i>?
Is picking out the wisest man among them, a task within
the range of their capacities? Let any one listen to the
conversation of a farmer’s market-table, and then answer
how much he finds of that wisdom which is required to
discern wisdom in others. Or let him read the clap-trap
speeches made from the hustings with a view of pleasing
constituents, and then estimate the penetration of those
who are to be thus pleased. Even among the higher order
of electors he will meet with gross political ignorance—with
notions that Acts of Parliament can do whatever it is
thought well they should do; that the value of gold can be
fixed by law; that distress can be cured by poor-laws;
and so forth. If he descends a step, he will find in the
still-prevalent ideas that machinery is injurious to the
working-classes, and that extravagance is “good for trade,”
indices of a yet smaller insight. And in the lower and
larger class, formed by those who think that their personal
interest in good government is not worth the trouble
of voting, or is outbalanced by the loss of a customer,
or is of less value than a bribe, he will perceive an
almost hopeless stupidity. Without going the length of
Mr. Carlyle, and defining the people as “twenty-seven
millions, mostly fools,” he will confess that they are but
sparely gifted with wisdom.</p>

<p>That these should succeed in
choosing the fittest <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
governors, would be strange; and that they do not so
succeed is manifest. Even as judged by the most
common-sense tests, their selections are absurd, as we
shall shortly see.</p>

<p>It is a self-evident truth that we may most safely trust
those whose interests are identical with our own; and that
it is very dangerous to trust those whose interests are
antagonistic to our own. All the legal securities we take
in our transactions with one another, are so many recognitions
of this truth. We are not satisfied with <i>professions</i>.
If another’s position is such that he must be liable to
motives at variance with the promises he makes, we take
care, by introducing an artificial motive (the dread of legal
penalties), to make it his interest to fulfil these promises.
Down to the asking for a receipt, our daily business-habits
testify that, in consequence of the prevailing selfishness, it
it extremely imprudent to expect men to regard the claims
of others equally with their own: all asseverations of good
faith notwithstanding. Now it might have been thought
that even the modicum of sense possessed by the majority
of electors, would have led them to recognize this fact in
the choice of their rep­re­sen­ta­tives. But they show a
total disregard of it. While the theory of our Constitution,
in conformity with this same fact, assumes
that the three divisions composing the Legislature will
severally pursue each its own ends—while our history
shows that Monarch, Lords, and Commons, <i>have</i> all along
more or less conspicuously done this; our electors manifest
by their votes, the belief that their interests will be as
well cared for by members of the titled class as by members
of their own class. Though, in their determined opposition
to the Reform-Bill, the aristocracy showed how
greedy they were, not only of their legitimate power
but of their illegitimate power—though, by the enactment
and pertinacious maintenance of the Corn-Laws,
they proved how little popular welfare
weighed in the <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span>
scale against their own profits—though they have ever
displayed a watchful jealousy even of their smallest
privileges, whether equitable or inequitable (as witness the
recent complaint in the House of Lords, that the Mercantile
Marine Act calls on lords of manors to show their titles
before they can claim the wrecks thrown on the shores of
their estates, which before they had always done by prescription)—though
they have habitually pursued that self-seeking
policy which men so placed were sure to pursue;
yet con­stit­uen­cies have decided that members of the aristocracy
may fitly be chosen as rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the people.
Our present House of Commons contains 98 Irish peers
and sons of English peers; 66 blood-relations of peers;
and 67 connexions of peers by marriage: in all, 231 members
whose interests, or sympathies, or both, are with the
nobility rather than the commonalty. We are quite prepared
to hear the doctrine implied in this criticism condemned
by rose-water politicians as narrow and prejudiced.
To such we simply reply that they and their friends fully
recognize this doctrine when it suits them to do so. Why
do they wish to prevent the town-con­stit­uen­cies from predominating
over the county-ones; if they do not believe
that each division of the community will consult its own
welfare? Or what plea can there be for Lord John
Russell’s proposal to represent minorities, unless it be
the plea that those who have the opportunity will sacrifice
the interests of others to their own? Or how shall we
explain the anxiety of the upper class, to keep a tight
rein on the growing power of the lower class, save from
their consciousness that <i>bonâ fide</i> rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the
lower class would be less regardful of their privileges
than they are themselves? If there be any reason in the
theory of the Constitution, then, while the members of the
House of Peers should belong to the peerage, the members
of the House of Commons should belong to the commonalty.
Either the constitutional theory is sheer
nonsense, or else <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span>
the choice of lords as rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the people proves
the folly of con­stit­uen­cies.</p>

<p>But this folly by no means ends here: it works out other
results quite as absurd. What should we think of a man
giving his servants equal authority with himself over the
affairs of his household? Suppose the shareholders in a
railway-company were to elect, as members of their board
of directors, the secretary, engineer, superintendent, traffic-manager,
and others such. Should we not be astonished
at their stupidity? Should we not prophesy that the
private advantage of officials would frequently override the
welfare of the company? Yet our parliamentary electors
commit a blunder of just the same kind. For what are
military and naval officers but servants of the nation; standing
to it in a relation like that in which the officers of a
railway-company stand to the company? Do they not perform
public work? do they not take public pay? And do not
their interests differ from those of the public, as the interests
of the employed from those of the employer? The impropriety
of admitting executive agents of the State into the
Legislature, has over and over again thrust itself into
notice; and in minor cases has been prevented by sundry
Acts of Parliament. Enumerating those disqualified for
the House of Commons, Blackstone says―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“No persons concerned in the management of any duties or taxes created
since 1692, except the commissioners of the treasury, nor any of the officers
following, <i>viz.</i> commissioners of prizes, transports, sick and wounded, wine
licences, navy, and victualling; secretaries or receivers of prizes; comptrollers
of the army accounts; agents for regiments; governors of plantations,
and their deputies; officers of Minorca or Gibraltar; officers of the excise
and customs; clerks and deputies in the several offices of the treasury, exchequer,
navy, victualling, admiralty, pay of the army and navy, secretaries
of state, salt, stamps, appeals, wine licences, hackney coaches, hawkers and
pedlars, nor any persons that hold any new office under the crown created
since 1705, are capable of being elected, or sitting as members.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="pcontinue">In which list naval and military
officers would doubtless
have been included, had they not always been too powerful
a body and too closely identified with
the dominant classes. <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
Glaring, however, as is the impolicy of appointing public
servants to make the laws; and clearly as this impolicy is
recognized in the above-specified exclusions from time to
time enacted; the people at large seem totally oblivious of
it. At the last general election they returned 9 naval
officers, 46 military officers, and 51 retired military officers,
who, in virtue of education, friendship, and <i>esprit de corps</i>,
take the same views with their active comrades—in all 106:
not including 64 officers of militia and yeomanry, whose
sympathies and ambitions are in a considerable degree the
same. If any one thinks that this large infusion of officialism
is of no consequence, let him look in the division-lists.
Let him inquire how much it has had to do with the
maintenance of the purchase-system. Let him ask whether
the almost insuperable obstacles to the promotion of the
private soldier, have not been strengthened by it. Let
him see what share it had in keeping up those worn-out
practices, and forms, and mis-arrangements, which
entailed the disasters of our late war. Let him consider
whether the hushing-up of the Crimean Inquiry and the
whitewashing of delinquents were not aided by it. Yet,
though abundant experience thus confirms what common
sense would beforehand have predicted; and though, notwithstanding
the late disasters, exposures, and public
outcry for army-reform, the influence of the military caste
is so great that the reform has been staved-off; our con­stit­uen­cies
are stupid enough to send to Parliament as many
military officers as ever!</p>

<p>Not even now have we reached the end of these impolitic
selections. The general principle on which we have been
insisting, and which is recognized by expounders of the
constitution when they teach that the legislative and
executive divisions of the Government should be distinct—this
general principle is yet further sinned against; though
not in so literal a manner. For though they do not take
State-pay, and are not
nominally Government-officers, yet, <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span>
practically, lawyers are members of the executive organization.
They form an important part of the apparatus for
the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice. By the working of this
apparatus they make their profits; and their welfare
depends on its being so worked as to bring them profits,
rather than on its being so worked as to administer justice.
Exactly as military officers have interests distinct from,
and often antagonistic to, the efficiency of the army; so,
barristers and solicitors have interests distinct from, and
often antagonistic to, the cheap and prompt enforcement
of the law. And that they are habitually swayed by these
antagonistic interests, is notorious. So strong is the bias,
as sometimes even to destroy the power of seeing from any
other than the professional stand-point. We have ourselves
heard a lawyer declaiming on the damage which the
County-Courts-Act had done to the profession; and
expecting his non-professional hearers to join him in
condemning it there-for! And if, as all the world knows,
the legal conscience is not of the tenderest, is it wise to
depute lawyers to frame the laws which they will be concerned
in carrying out; and the carrying out of which must
affect their private incomes? Are barristers, who constantly
take fees for work which they do not perform,
and attorneys, whose bills are so often exorbitant that a
special office has been established for taxing them—are
these, of all others, to be trusted in a position which
would be trying even to the most disinterested? Nevertheless,
the towns and counties of England have returned
to the present House of Commons 98 lawyers—some
60 of them in actual practice, and the rest retired, but
doubtless retaining those class-views acquired during their
professional careers.</p>

<p>These criticisms on the conduct of con­stit­uen­cies do not
necessarily commit us to the assertion that <i>none</i> belonging
to the official and aristocratic classes ought to be chosen.
Though it would be safer to carry out,
in these important <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span>
cases, the general principle which, as above shown, Parliament
has itself recognized and enforced in unimportant
cases; yet we are not prepared to say that occasional
exceptions might not be made, on good cause being shown.
All we aim to show is the gross impolicy of selecting so
large a proportion of rep­re­sen­ta­tives from classes having
interests different from those of the general public. That
in addition to more than a third taken from the dominant
class, who already occupy one division of the Legislature,
the House of Commons should contain nearly another third
taken from the naval, military, and legal classes, whose
policy, like that of the dominant class, is to maintain things
as they are; we consider a decisive proof of electoral misjudgment.
That out of the 654 members, of which the
People’s House now consists, there should be but 250 who,
as considered from a class point of view, are eligible, or
tolerably eligible (for we include a considerable number
who are more or less objectionable), is significant of anything
but popular good sense. That into an assembly
established to protect their interests, the commonalty of
England should have sent one-third whose interests are the
same as their own, and two-thirds whose interests are at
variance with their own, proves a scarcely credible lack
of wisdom; and seems an awkward fact for the rep­re­sen­ta­tive
theory.</p>

<p>If the intelligence of the mass is thus not sufficient even to choose
out men who by position and occupation are fit rep­re­sen­ta­tives,
still less is it sufficient to choose out men who are the fittest
in character and capacity. To see who will be liable to the bias
of private advantage is a very easy thing; to see who is wisest is
a very difficult thing; and those who do not succeed in the first
must necessarily fail in the last. The higher the wisdom the more
in­comp­re­hen­si­ble does it become by ignorance. It is a manifest fact
that the popular man or writer, is always one who is but little in
advance of the mass, and consequently <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span> understandable by them:
never the man who is far in advance of them and out of their sight.
Appreciation of another implies some community of thought. “Only the
man of worth can recognize worth in men. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The worthiest, if he
appealed to universal suffrage, would have but a poor chance. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Alas! Jesus Christ, asking the Jews what <i>he</i> deserved—was not the
answer, Death on the gallows!” And though men do not now-a-days stone
the prophet, they, at any rate, ignore him. As Mr. Carlyle says in his
vehement way―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“If of ten men nine are recognisable as fools, which is a common
calculation, how, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the name of wonder, will you ever get a
ballot-box to grind you out a wisdom from the votes of these ten men?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I tell you a million blockheads looking authoritatively into
one man of what you call genius, or noble sense, will make nothing but
nonsense out of him and his qualities, and his virtues and defects, if
they look till the end of time.”</p></blockquote>

<p>So that, even were electors content to choose the man
proved by general evidence to be the most far-seeing, and
refrained from testing him by the coincidence of his views
with their own, there would be small chance of their hitting
on the best. But judging of him, as they do, by asking him
whether he thinks this or that crudity which they think, it
is manifest that they will fix on one far removed from the
best. Their deputy will be truly rep­re­sen­ta­tive;—rep­re­sen­ta­tive,
that is, of the average stupidity.</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now let us look at the assembly of rep­re­sen­ta­tives
thus chosen. Already we have noted the unfit composition
of this assembly as respects the interests of its members;
and we have just seen what the rep­re­sen­ta­tive theory itself
implies as to their intelligence. Let us now, however, consider
them more nearly under this last head.</p>

<p>And first, what is the work they undertake? Observe,
we do not say the work which they <i>ought</i> to do, but the
work which they <i>propose</i> to do, and <i>try</i> to do. This comprehends
the regulation of nearly all actions going on
throughout society. Besides devising
measures to prevent <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span>
the aggression of citizens on one another, and to secure each
the quiet possession of his own; and besides assuming the
further function, also needful in the present state of mankind,
of defending the nation as a whole against invaders;
they unhesitatingly take on themselves to provide for
countless wants, to cure countless ills, to oversee countless
affairs. Out of the many beliefs men have held respecting
God, Creation, the Future, etc., they presume to decide
which are true; and authorize an army of priests to perpetually
repeat them to the people. The distress resulting
from improvidence, they undertake to remove: they settle
the minimum which each ratepayer shall give in charity,
and how the proceeds shall be administered. Judging that
emigration will not naturally go on fast enough, they provide
means for carrying off some of the labouring classes to the
colonies. Certain that social necessities will not cause a
sufficiently rapid spread of knowledge, and confident that
they know what knowledge is most required, they use public
money for the building of schools and paying of teachers;
they print and publish State-school-books; they employ
inspectors to see that their standard of education is conformed
to. Playing the part of doctor, they insist that
every one shall use their specific, and escape the danger of
small-pox by submitting to an attack of cow-pox. Playing
the part of moralist, they decide which dramas are fit to be
acted and which are not. Playing the part of artist, they
prompt the setting up of drawing-schools, provide masters
and models; and, at Marlborough House, enact what shall
be considered good taste and what bad. Through their
lieutenants, the corporations of towns, they furnish appliances
for the washing of peoples’ skins and clothes; they, in
some cases, manufacture gas and put down water-pipes;
they lay out sewers and cover over cess-pools; they
establish public libraries and make public gardens. Moreover,
they determine how houses shall be built, and what is a
safe construction for a ship; they take
measures for the <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
security of railway-travelling; they fix the hour after which
public-houses may not be open; they regulate the prices
chargeable by vehicles plying in the London streets; they
inspect lodging-houses; they arrange for burial-grounds;
they fix the hours of factory hands. If some social process
does not seem to them to be going on fast enough, they
stimulate it; where the growth is not in the direction which
they think most desirable, they alter it; and so they seek
to realize some undefined ideal community.</p>

<p>Such being the task undertaken, what, let us ask, are the
qualifications for discharging it? Supposing it possible to
achieve all this, what must be the knowledge and capacities
of those who shall achieve it? Successfully to prescribe
for society, it is needful to know the structure of society—the
principles on which it is organized—the natural laws of
its progress. If there be not a true understanding of what
constitutes social development, there must necessarily be
grave mistakes made in checking these changes and fostering
those. If there be lack of insight respecting the mutual
dependence of the many functions which, taken together,
make up the national life, unforeseen disasters will ensue
from not perceiving how an interference with one will affect
the rest. That is to say, there must be a due acquaintance
with the social science—the science involving all others;
the science standing above all others in complexity.</p>

<p>And now, how far do our legislators possess this qualification?
Do they in any moderate degree display it? Do
they make even a distant approximation to it? That many
of them are very good classical scholars is beyond doubt:
not a few have written first-rate Latin verses, and can
enjoy a Greek play; but there is no obvious relation
between a memory well stocked with the words spoken
two thousand years ago, and an understanding disciplined
to deal with modern society. That in learning the languages
of the past they have learnt some of its history, is
true; but considering that this history
is mainly a <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span>
narrative of battles and plots and negociations and treacheries,
it does not throw much light on social philosophy—not
even the simplest principles of political economy have ever
been gathered from it. We do not question, either, that
a moderate per centage of members of Parliament are
fair mathematicians; and that mathematical discipline is
valuable. As, however, political problems are not susceptible
of mathematical analysis, their studies in this direction
cannot much aid them in legislation. To the large body
of military officers who sit as rep­re­sen­ta­tives, we would not
for a moment deny a competent knowledge of fortification,
of strategy, of regimental discipline; but we do not see
that these throw much light on the causes and cure of
national evils. Indeed, considering that war fosters anti-social
sentiments, and that the government of soldiers is
necessarily despotic, military education and habits are more
likely to unfit than to fit men for regulating the doings of
a free people. Extensive acquaintance with the laws, may
doubtless be claimed by the many barristers chosen by
our con­stit­uen­cies; and this seems a kind of information
having some relation to the work to be done. Unless,
however, this information is more than technical—unless it
is accompanied by knowledge of the ramified consequences
which laws have produced in times past and are producing
now (which nobody will assert), it cannot give much
insight into Social Science. A familiarity with laws is no
more a preparation for rational legislation, than would a
familiarity with all the nostrums men have ever used be a
preparation for the rational practice of medicine. Nowhere,
then, in our rep­re­sen­ta­tive body, do we find appropriate
culture. Here is a clever novelist, and there a successful
maker of railways; this member has acquired a large
fortune in trade, and that member is noted as an agricultural
improver; but none of these achievements imply
fitness for controlling and adjusting social processes.
Among the many who have passed
through the public <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
school and university <i>curriculum</i>—including though they
may a few Oxford double-firsts and one or two Cambridge
wranglers—there are none who have received the discipline
required by the true legislator. None have that competent
knowledge of Science in general, culminating in the
Science of Life, which can alone form a basis for the
Science of Society. For it is one of those open secrets
which seem the more secret because they are so open,
that all phenomena displayed by a nation are phenomena
of Life, and are dependent on the laws of Life. There is
no growth, decay, evil, improvement, or change of any
kind, going on in the body politic, but what has its cause
in the actions of human beings; and there are no actions
of human beings but what conform to the laws of Life in
general, and cannot be truly understood until those laws
are understood.</p>

<p>See, then, the immense incongruity between the end and
the means. See on the one hand the countless difficulties
of the task; and on the other hand the almost total
unpreparedness of those who undertake it. Need we
wonder that legislation is ever breaking down? Is it not
natural that complaint, amendment, and repeal, should
form the staple business of every session? Is there anything
more than might be expected in the absurd Jack-Cadeisms
which disgrace the debates? Even without
setting up so high a standard of qualification as that above
specified, the unfitness of most rep­re­sen­ta­tives for their duties
is abundantly manifest. You need but glance over the
miscellaneous list of noblemen, baronets, squires, merchants,
barristers, engineers, soldiers, sailors, railway-directors, etc.,
and then ask what training their previous lives have given
them for the intricate business of legislation, to see at once
how extreme must be the incompetence. One would think
that the whole system had been framed on the sayings of
some political Dogberry:—“The art of healing is difficult;
the art of government easy.
The understanding of <span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span>
arithmetic comes by study; while the understanding of
society comes by instinct. Watchmaking requires a long
apprenticeship; but there needs none for the making of
institutions. To manage a shop properly requires teaching;
but the management of a people may be undertaken without
preparation.” Were we to be visited by some wiser
Gulliver, or, as in the “Micromegas” of Voltaire, by some
inhabitant of another sphere, his account of our political
institutions might run somewhat as follows:―</p>

<p>“I found that the English were governed by an assembly
of men, said to embody the ‘collective wisdom.’ This
assembly, joined with some other authorities which seem
practically subordinate to it, has unlimited power. I was
much perplexed by this. With us it is customary to define
the office of any appointed body; and, above all things, to
see that it does not defeat the ends for which it was
appointed. But both the theory and the practice of this
English Government imply that it may do whatever it
pleases. Though, by their current maxims and usages, the
English recognize the right of property as sacred—though
the infraction of it is considered by them one of the gravest
crimes—though the laws profess to be so jealous of it as to
punish even the stealing of a turnip; yet their legislators
suspend it at will. They take the money of citizens for
any project which they choose to undertake; though such
project was not in the least contemplated by those who
gave them authority—nay, though the greater part of the
citizens from whom the money is taken had no share in
giving them such authority. Each citizen can hold property
only so long as the 654 deputies do not want it. It
seemed to me that an exploded doctrine once current
among them of ‘the divine right of kings,’ had simply been
changed into the divine right of Parliaments.</p>

<p>“I was at first inclined to think that the constitution of
things on the Earth was totally different from what it is
with us; for the current political
philosophy here, implies <span class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span>
that acts are not right or wrong in themselves but are
made one or the other by the votes of law-makers. In our
world it is considered manifest that if a number of beings
live together, there must, in virtue of their natures, be
certain primary conditions on which only they can work
satisfactorily in concert; and we infer that the conduct
which breaks through these conditions is bad. In the
English legislature, however, a proposal to regulate conduct
by any such abstract standard would be held absurd. I
asked one of their members of Parliament whether a
majority of the House could legitimize murder. He said,
No. I asked him whether it could sanctify robbery. He
thought not. But I could not make him see that if murder
and robbery are intrinsically wrong, and not to be made
right by decisions of statesmen, that similarly <i>all</i> actions
must be either right or wrong, apart from the authority of
the law; and that if the right and wrong of the law are
not in harmony with this intrinsic right and wrong, the
law itself is criminal. Some, indeed, among the English
think as we do. One of their remarkable men (<i>not</i> included
in their Assembly of Notables) writes thus:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“‘To ascertain better and better what the will of the Eternal was and is
with us, what the laws of the Eternal are, all Parliaments, Ecumenic
Councils, Congresses, and other Collective Wisdoms, have had this for their
object. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nevertheless, in the inexplicable universal votings and
debatings of these Ages, an idea or rather a dumb presumption to the
contrary has gone idly abroad; and at this day, over extensive tracts of the
world, poor human beings are to be found, whose practical belief it is that if
we “vote” this or that, so this or that will thenceforth <i>be</i>. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Practically,
men have come to imagine that the Laws of this Universe, like the laws of
constitutional countries, are decided by voting. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is an idle fancy.
The Laws of this Universe, of which if the Laws of England are not an
exact transcript, they should passionately study to become such, are fixed
by the everlasting congruity of things, and are not fixable or changeable
by voting!’</p></blockquote>

<p>“But I find that, contemptuously disregarding all such
protests, the English legislators persevere in their
hyperatheistic
notion, that an Act of Parliament duly enforced by
State-officers, will work out any object:
no question being <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
put whether Laws of Nature permit. I forgot to ask whether
they considered that different kinds of food could be made
wholesome or unwholesome by State-decree.</p>

<p>“One thing that struck me was the curious way in which
the members of their House of Commons judge of one
another’s capacities. Many who expressed opinions of the
crudest kinds, or trivial platitudes, or worn-out superstitions,
were civilly treated. Follies as great as that but a few
years since uttered by one of their ministers, who said that
free-trade was contrary to common sense, were received in
silence. But I was present when one of their number, who,
as I thought, was speaking very rationally, made a mistake
in his pronunciation—made what they call a wrong quantity;
and immediately there arose a shout of derision. It seemed
quite tolerable that a member should know little or nothing
about the business he was there to transact; but quite intolerable
that he should be ignorant on a point of no moment.</p>

<p>“The English pique themselves on being especially
practical—have a great contempt for theorizers, and profess
to be guided exclusively by facts. Before making or altering
a law it is the custom to appoint a committee of inquiry,
who send for men able to give information concerning the
matter in hand, and ask them some thousands of questions.
These questions, and the answers given to them, are printed
in large books, and distributed among the members of the
Houses of Parliament; and I was told that they spent about
£100,000 a year in thus collecting and distributing evidence.
Nevertheless, it appeared to me that the ministers and
rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the English people, pertinaciously adhere
to theories long ago disproved by the most conspicuous
facts. They pay great respect to petty details of evidence,
but of large truths they are quite regardless. Thus, the
experience of age after age has shown that their state-management
is almost invariably bad. The national estates
are so miserably administered as often
to bring loss <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span>
instead of gain. The government ship-yards are uniformly
extravagant and inefficient. The judicial system works so
ill that most citizens will submit to serious losses rather
than run risks of being ruined by law-suits. Countless
facts prove the Government to be the worst owner, the
worst manufacturer, the worst trader: in fact, the worst
manager, be the thing managed what it may. But though
the evidence of this is abundant and conclusive—though,
during a recent war, the bunglings of officials were as glaring
and multitudinous as ever; yet the belief that any proposed
duties will be satisfactorily discharged by a new public
department appointed to them, seems not a whit the
weaker. Legislators, thinking themselves practical, cling
to the plausible theory of an officially-regulated society,
spite of overwhelming evidence that official regulation
perpetually fails.</p>

<p>“Nay, indeed, the belief seems to gain strength among
these fact-loving English statesmen, notwithstanding the
facts are against it. Proposals for State-control over this
and the other, have been of late more rife than ever. And,
most remarkable of all, their rep­re­sen­ta­tive assembly lately
listened with grave faces to the assertion, made by one of their
high authorities, that State-workshops are more economical
than private workshops. Their prime minister, in defending
a recently-established arms-factory, actually told them that,
at one of their arsenals, certain missiles of war were manufactured
not only better than by the trade, but at about
one-third the price; and added, ‘<i>so it would be in all things</i>.’
The English being a trading people, who must be tolerably
familiar with the usual rates of profit among manufacturers,
and the margin for possible economy, the fact that they
should have got for their chief rep­re­sen­ta­tive one so utterly
in the dark on these matters, struck me as a wonderful
result of the rep­re­sen­ta­tive system.</p>

<p>“I did not inquire much further, for it
was manifest that <span class="xxpn" id="p309">{309}</span>
if these were really their wisest men, the English were not
a wise people.”</p>

<p class="padtopb">Representative government, then, cannot be called a success,
in so far as the choice of men is concerned. Those it
puts into power are the fittest neither in respect of their
interests, nor their culture, nor their wisdom. And as a
consequence, partly of this and partly of its complex and
cumbrous nature, rep­re­sen­ta­tive government is anything
but efficient for administrative purposes. In these respects
it is manifestly inferior to monarchical government. This
has the advantage of simplicity, which is always conducive
to efficiency. And it has the further advantage that the
power is in the hands of one who is directly concerned in
the good management of national affairs; seeing that the
continued maintenance of his power—nay, often his very
life—depends on this. For his own sake a monarch chooses
the wisest councillors he can find, regardless of class-distinctions.
His interest in getting the best help is too
great to allow of prejudices standing between him and a
far-seeing man. We see this abundantly illustrated. Did
not the kings of France take Richelieu, and Mazarin, and
Turgot to assist them? Had not Henry VIII. his Wolsey,
Elizabeth her Burleigh, James his Bacon, Cromwell his
Milton? And were not these men of greater calibre than
those who hold the reins under our constitutional <i>régime?</i>
So strong is the motive of an autocrat to make use of ability
wherever it exists, that he will, like Louis XI., take even his
barber into council if he finds him a clever fellow. Besides
choosing them for ministers and advisers, he seeks out the
most competent men for other offices. Napoleon raised his
marshals from the ranks; and owed his military success in
great part to the readiness with which he saw and availed
himself of merit wherever found. We have recently seen
in Russia how prompt was the recognition and promotion of
engineering talent in the case of Todleben;
and know to <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span>
our cost how greatly the prolonged defence of Sebastopol
was due to this. In the marked contrast to these cases
supplied by our own army, in which genius is ignored while
muffs are honoured—in which wealth and caste make the
advance of plebeian merit next to impossible—in which
jealousies between Queen’s service and Company’s service
render the best generalship almost unavailable; we see that
the rep­re­sen­ta­tive system fails in the officering of its
executive, as much as in the officering of its legislative. A
striking antithesis between the actions of the two forms of
government, is presented in the evidence given before the
Sebastopol Committee respecting the supply of huts to the
Crimean army—evidence showing that while, in his negotiations
with the English Government, the contractor for the
huts met with nothing but vacillation, delay, and official
rudeness, the conduct of the French Government was
marked by promptitude, decision, sound judgment, and
great civility. Everything goes to show that for administrative
efficiency, autocratic power is the best. If your aim
is a well-organized army—if you want to have sanitary
departments, and educational departments, and
charity-departments,
managed in a business-like way—if you would
have society actively regulated by staffs of State-agents;
then by all means choose that system of complete centralization
which we call despotism.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Probably, notwithstanding the hints dropped at the
outset, most have read the foregoing pages with surprise.
Very likely some have referred to the cover of the <i>Review</i>,
to see whether they have not, in mistake, taken up some
other than the “<i>Westminster</i>;” while some may, perhaps,
have accompanied their perusal by a running commentary
of epithets condemnatory of our seeming change of principles.
Let them not be alarmed. We have not in the
least swerved from the confession of faith set forth in our
prospectus. On the contrary, as we
shall shortly show, <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
our adhesion to free institutions is as strong as ever—nay,
has even gained strength through this apparently
antagonistic criticism.</p>

<p>The subordination of a nation to a man, is not a wholesome
but a vicious state of things: needful, indeed, for a
vicious humanity; but to be outgrown as fast as may be.
The instinct which makes it possible is anything but a
noble one. Call it “hero-worship,” and it looks respectable.
Call it what it is—a blind awe and fear of power, no
matter of what kind, but more especially of the brutal
kind; and it is by no means to be admired. Watch it in
early ages deifying the cannibal chief; singing the praises
of the successful thief; commemorating the most blood-thirsty
warriors; speaking with reverence of those who
had shown undying revenge; and erecting altars to such
as carried furthest the vices which disgrace humanity;
and the illusion disappears. Read how, where it was
strongest, it immolated crowds of victims at the tomb of
the dead king—how, at the altars raised to its heroes, it
habitually sacrificed prisoners and children to satisfy their
traditional appetite for human flesh—how it produced that
fealty of subjects to rulers which made possible endless
aggressions, battles, massacres, and horrors innumerable—how
it has mercilessly slain those who would not lick the
dust before its idols;—read all this, and the feeling no
longer seems so worthy an one. See it in later days
idealizing the worst as well as the best monarchs; receiving
assassins with acclamation; hurrahing before successful
treachery; rushing to applaud the processions and shows
and ceremonies wherewith effete power strengthens itself;
and it looks far from laudable. Autocracy presupposes
inferiority of nature on the part of both ruler and subject:
on the one side a cold, unsympathetic sacrificing of other’s
wills to self-will; on the other side a mean, cowardly
abandonment of the claims of manhood.
Our very language <span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
bears testimony to this. Do not <i>dignity</i>, <i>independence</i>,
and other words of approbation, imply a nature at variance
with this relation? Are not <i>tyrannical</i>, <i>arbitrary</i>, <i>despotic</i>,
epithets of reproach? and are not <i>truckling</i>, <i>fawning</i>,
<i>cringing</i>, epithets of contempt? Is not <i>slavish</i> a condemnatory
term? Does not <i>servile</i>, that is, serf-like, imply
littleness, meanness? And has not the word <i>villain</i>, which
originally meant bondsman, come to signify everything
which is hateful? That language should thus inadvertently
embody dislike for those who most display the
instinct of subordination, is alone sufficient proof that this
instinct is associated with evil dispositions. It has been
the parent of countless crimes. It is answerable for the
torturing and murder of the noble-minded who would not
submit—for the horrors of Bastiles and Siberias. It has
ever been the represser of knowledge, of free thought, of
true progress. In all times it has fostered the vices of
courts, and made those vices fashionable throughout
nations. With a George IV. on the throne, it weekly tells
ten thousand lies, in the shape of prayers for a “most
religious and gracious king.” Whether you read the
annals of the far past—whether you look at the various
uncivilized races dispersed over the globe—or whether
you contrast the existing nations of Europe; you equally
find that submission to authority decreases as morality and
intelligence increase. From ancient warrior-worship down
to modern flunkeyism, the sentiment has ever been strongest
where human nature has been vilest.</p>

<p>This relation between barbarism and loyalty, is one of
those beneficent arrangements which “the servant and
interpreter of nature” everywhere meets with. The subordination
of many to one, is a form of society needful for
men so long as their natures are savage, or anti-social;
and that it may be maintained, it is needful that they
should have an extreme awe of the one.
Just in proportion <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
as their conduct to one another is such as to breed
perpetual antagonism, endangering social union; just in
that proportion must there be a reverence for the strong,
determined, cruel ruler, who alone can repress their
explosive natures and keep them from mutual destruction.
Among such a people any form of free government is an
impossibility. There must be a despotism as stern as the
people are savage; and, that such a despotism may exist,
there must be a superstitious worship of the despot. But
as fast as the discipline of social life modifies character—as
fast as, through lack of use, the old predatory instincts
dwindle—as fast as the sympathetic feelings grow; so
fast does this hard rule become less necessary; so fast
does the authority of the ruler diminish; so fast does the
awe of him disappear. From being originally god, or
demi-god, he comes at length to be a very ordinary person;
liable to be criticized, ridiculed, caricatured. Various
influences conspire to this result. Accumulating knowledge
gradually divests the ruler of those supernatural attributes
at first ascribed to him. The conceptions which developing
science gives of the grandeur of creation, as well as the
constancy and irresistibleness of its Omnipresent Cause,
make all feel the comparative littleness of human power;
and the awe once felt for the great man is, by degrees,
transferred to that Universe of which the great man is
seen to form but an insignificant part. Increase of
population, with its average per-centage of great men,
involves the comparative frequency of such; and the more
numerous they are the less respect can be given to each:
they dwarf one another. As society becomes settled and
organized, its welfare and progress become more and more
independent of any one. In a primitive society the death
of a chief may alter the whole course of things; but in a
society like ours, things go on much as before, no matter
who dies. Thus, many influences combine to diminish
autocratic power, whether political or other.
It is true, <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
not only in the sense in which Tennyson writes it, but also
in a higher sense, that―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight"><div class="nowrap"> <p
class="pcontinue">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;“the individual withers, and the
world is more and more.”</p></div></blockquote>

<p>Further, it is to be noted that while the unlimited
authority of the greatest man ceases to be needful; and
while the superstitious awe which upholds that unlimited
authority decreases; it at the same time becomes impossible
to get the greatest man to the top. In a rude social
state, where might is right, where war is the business of
life, where the qualities required in the ruler, alike for
controlling his subjects and defeating his enemies, are
bodily strength, courage, cunning, will, it is easy to pick
out the best; or rather—he picks himself out. The
qualities which make him the fittest governor for the
barbarians around him, are the qualities by which he gets
the mastery over them. But in an advanced, complex,
and comparatively peaceful state like ours, these are not
the qualities needed; and even were they needed, the
firmly-organized arrangements of society do not allow the
possessor of them to break through to the top. For the
rule of a settled, civilized community, the char­ac­ter­is­tics
required are—not a love of conquest but a desire for the
general happiness; not undying hate of enemies but a
calm dispassionate equity; not artful manœuvring but
philosophic insight. How is the man most endowed with
these to be found? In no country is he ordinarily born
heir to the throne; and that he can be chosen out of
thirty millions of people none will be foolish enough to
think. The incapacity for recognizing the greatest worth,
we have already seen illustrated in our parliamentary
elections. And if the few thousands forming a constituency
cannot pick out from among themselves their
wisest man, still less can the millions forming a nation
do it. Just as fast as society becomes populous, complex,
peaceful; so fast does the political supremacy of the best
become impossible. <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span></p>

<p>But even were the relation of autocrat and slave a
morally wholesome one; and even were it possible to find
the fittest man to be autocrat; we should still contend that
such a form of government is bad. We should not contend
this simply on the ground that self-government is a valuable
educator. But we should take the ground that no human
being, however wise and good, is fit to be sole ruler over
the doings of an involved society; and that, with the best
intentions, a benevolent despot is very likely to produce
the most terrible mischiefs which would else have been
impossible. We will take the case of all others the most
favourable to those who would give supreme power to the
best. We will instance Mr. Carlyle’s model hero—Cromwell.
Doubtless there was much in the manners of the
times when Puritanism arose, to justify its disgust. Doubtless
the vices and follies bequeathed by effete Catholicism
still struggling for existence, were bad enough to create a
reactionary asceticism. It is in the order of Nature, however,
that men’s habits and pleasures are not to be changed
suddenly. For any <i>permanent</i> effect to be produced it must
be produced slowly. Better tastes, higher aspirations, must
be developed; not enforced from without. Disaster is
sure to result from the withdrawal of lower gratifications
before higher ones have taken their places; for gratification
of some kind is a condition to healthful existence.
Whatever ascetic morality, or rather immorality, may say,
pleasures and pains are the incentives and restraints by
which Nature keeps her progeny from destruction. No
contemptuous title of “pig-philosophy” will alter the
eternal fact that Misery is the highway to Death; while
Happiness is added Life and the giver of Life. But indignant
Puritanism could not see this truth; and with the
extravagance of fanaticism sought to abolish pleasure in
general. Getting into power, it put down not only questionable
amusements but all others along
with them. And <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span>
for these repressions Cromwell, either as enacting, maintaining,
or allowing them, was responsible. What, now,
was the result of this attempt to dragoon men into virtue?
What came when the strong man who thought he was thus
“helping God to mend all,” died? A dreadful reaction
brought in one of the most degraded periods of our history.
Into the newly-garnished house entered “seven other spirits
more wicked than the first.” For generations the English
character was lowered. Vice was gloried in, virtue was
ridiculed; dramatists made marriage the stock-subject of
laughter; profaneness and obscenity flourished; high
aspirations ceased; the whole age was corrupt. Not until
George III. reigned was there a better standard of living.
And for this century of demoralization we have, in great
measure, to thank Cromwell. Is it, then, so clear that the
domination of one man, righteous though he may be, is
a blessing?</p>

<p>Lastly, it is to be remarked that when the political
supremacy of the greatest no longer exists in an overt form,
it still continues in a disguised and more beneficent form.
For is it not manifest that in these latter days the wise man
eventually gets his edicts enforced by others, if not by himself.
Adam Smith, from his chimney-corner, dictated
greater changes than prime ministers do. A General
Thompson who forges the weapons with which the Anti-Corn-Law
battle is fought—a Cobden and a Bright who add
to and wield them, forward civilization much more than
those who hold sceptres. Repugnant as the fact may be to
statesmen, it is yet one not to be gainsayed. Whoever,
to the great effects already produced by Free-trade, joins
the far greater effects which will be hereafter produced,
must see that the revolution initiated by these men is far
wider than has been initiated by any potentate of modern
times. As Mr. Carlyle very well knows, those who elaborate
new truths and teach them to
their fellows, are <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
now-a-days the real rulers—“the unacknowledged legislators”—the
virtual kings. Thus we have the good which great
men can do us, while we are saved from the evil.</p>

<p>No; the old <i>régime</i> has passed away. For ourselves at
least, the subordination of the many to the one has become
alike needless, repugnant, and impossible. Good for its
time, bad for ours, the ancient “hero-worship” is dead;
and happily no declamations, be they never so eloquent,
can revive it.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Here seem to be two irreconcileable positions—two
mutually-destructive arguments. First, a condemnatory
criticism on rep­re­sen­ta­tive government, and then a still
more condemnatory criticism on monarchical government:
each apparently abolishing the other.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the paradox is easily explicable. It is
quite possible to say all that we have said concerning the
defects of rep­re­sen­ta­tive government, and still to hold that
it is the best form of government. Nay, it is quite possible
to derive a more profound conviction of its superiority from
the very evidence which appears so unfavourable to it.</p>

<p>For nothing that we have urged tells against its goodness
as a means of securing justice between man and man, or
class and class. Abundant evidence shows that the maintenance
of equitable relations among its subjects, which
forms the essential business of a ruling power, is surest
when the ruling power is of popular origin; notwithstanding
the defects to which such a ruling power is liable. For
discharging the true function of a government, rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government is shown to be the best, alike by its <i>origin</i>,
its <i>theory</i>, and its <i>results</i>. Let us glance at the facts under
these three heads.</p>

<p>Alike in Spain, in England, and in France, popular
power embodied itself as a check upon kingly tyranny,
that is—kingly injustice. The earliest accounts we have of
the Spanish Cortes, say that it was their
office to advise <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span>
the King; and to follow their advice was his duty. They
petitioned, remonstrated, complained of grievances, and
supplicated for redress. The King, having acceded to
their requirements, swore to observe them; and it was
agreed that any act of his in contravention of the statutes
thus established, should be “respected as the King’s
commands, but not executed, as contrary to the rights and
privileges of the subject.” In all which we see very clearly
that the special aim of the Cortes was to get rectified the
injustices committed by the King or others; that the King
was in the habit of breaking the promises of amendment
he made to them; and that they had to adopt measures to
enforce the fulfilment of his promises. In England we
trace analogous facts. The Barons who bridled the tyranny
of King John, though not formally appointed, were virtually
impromptu rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the nation; and in
their demand that justice should neither be sold, denied,
nor delayed, we discern the social evils which led to this
taking of the power into their own hands. In early times
the knights and burgesses, summoned by the King with
the view of getting supplies from them, had for their
especial business to obtain from him the redress of grievances,
that is—the execution of justice; and in their
eventually-obtained and occasionally-exercised power of
withholding supplies until justice was granted, we see both
the need there was for remedying the iniquities of autocracy,
and the adaptation of rep­re­sen­ta­tive institutions to this
end. And the further development of popular power
latterly obtained, originated from the demand for fairer laws—for
less class-privilege, class-exemption, class-injustice:
a fact which the speeches of the Reform-Bill agitation
abundantly prove. In France, again, rep­re­sen­ta­tive government
grew into a definite form under the stimulus of
unbearable oppression. When the accumulated extortion
of centuries had reduced the mass of the people to misery—when
millions of haggard faces were
seen throughout the <span class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span>
land—when starving complainants were hanged on “a
gallows forty feet high”—when the exactions and cruelties
of good-for-nothing kings and vampire-nobles had brought
the nation to the eve of dissolution; there came, as a
remedy, an assembly of men elected by the people.</p>

<p>That, considered <i>a priori</i>, rep­re­sen­ta­tive government is
fitted for establishing just laws, is implied by the unanimity
with which Spanish, English, and French availed themselves
of it to this end; as well as by the endeavours latterly made
by other European nations to do the like. The <i>rationale</i> of
the matter is simple enough. Manifestly, on the average of
cases, a man will protect his own interests more solicitously
than others will protect them for him. Manifestly, where
regulations have to be made affecting the interests of
several men, they are most likely to be equitably made
when all those concerned are present, and have equal
shares in the making of them. And manifestly, where
those concerned are so numerous and so dispersed, that it
is physically impossible for them all to take part in the
framing of such regulations, the next best thing is for the
citizens in each locality to appoint one of their number to
speak for them, to care for their claims, to be their rep­re­sen­ta­tive.
The general principle is that the welfare of all will
be most secure when each looks after his own welfare; and
the principle is carried out as directly as the circumstances
permit. It is inferable, alike from human nature and from
history, that a single man cannot be trusted with the
interests of a nation of men, where his real or imagined
interests clash with theirs. It is similarly inferable from
human nature and from history, that no small section of a
nation, as the nobles, can be expected to consult the welfare
of the people at large in preference to their own. And it
is further inferable that only in a general diffusion of
political power, is there a safeguard for the general
welfare. This has all along been the conviction under
which rep­re­sen­ta­tive government
has been advocated, <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span>
maintained, and extended. From the early writs summoning the
members of the House of Commons—writs which declared it
to be a most equitable rule that the laws which concerned
all should be approved of by all—down to the reasons now
urged by the unenfranchised for a participation in political
power, this is the implied theory. Observe, nothing is said
about wisdom or administrative ability. From the beginning,
the end in view has been <i>justice</i>. Whether we
consider the question in the abstract, or whether we
examine the opinions men have entertained upon it from
old times down to the present day, we equally see the
theory of rep­re­sen­ta­tive government to be, that it is the
best means of insuring equitable social relations.</p>

<p>And do not the results justify the theory? Did not our
early Parliaments, after long-continued struggles, succeed
in curbing the licentious exercise of royal power, and in
establishing the rights of the subject? Are not the comparative
security and justice enjoyed under our form of
government, indicated by the envy with which other
nations regard it? Was not the election of the French
Constituent Assembly followed by the sweeping away of
the grievous burdens that weighed down the people—by
the abolition of tithes, seignorial dues, gabelle, excessive
preservation of game—by the withdrawal of numerous
feudal privileges and immunities—by the manumission of
the slaves in the French colonies?—And has not that
extension of our own electoral system embodied in the
Reform-Bill, brought about more equitable arrangements?—as
witness the repeal of the Corn-Laws, and the equalization
of probate and legacy duties. The proofs are undeniable.
It is clear, both <i>a priori</i> and <i>a posteriori</i>, that rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government is especially adapted for the establishment
and maintenance of just laws.</p>

<p>And now mark that the objections to rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government awhile since urged, scarcely tell against it at all,
so long as it does not exceed
this comparatively limited <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span>
function. Though its mediocrity of intellect makes it
incompetent to oversee and regulate the countless involved
processes which make up the national life; it nevertheless
has quite enough intellect to enact and enforce those simple
principles of equity which underlie the right conduct of
citizens to one another. These are such that the commonest
minds can understand their chief applications. Stupid as
may be the average elector, he can see the propriety of
such regulations as shall prevent men from murdering and
robbing; he can understand the fitness of laws which enforce
the payment of debts; he can perceive the need of
measures to prevent the strong from tyrannizing over the
weak; and he can feel the rectitude of a judicial system that
is the same for rich and poor. The average rep­re­sen­ta­tive
may be but of small capacity, but he is competent, under
the leadership of his wiser fellows, to devise appliances for
carrying out these necessary restraints; or rather—he is
competent to uphold the set of appliances slowly elaborated
by the many generations of his predecessors, and to do
something towards improving and extending them in those
directions where the need is most manifest. It is true that
even these small demands upon electoral and senatorial
wisdom are but imperfectly met. But though con­stit­uen­cies
are blind to the palpable truth that if they would
escape laws which favour the nobility at the expense of the
commonalty, they must cease to choose rep­re­sen­ta­tives
from among the nobility; yet when the injustice of this
class-legislation is glaring—as in the case of the Corn-Laws—they
have sense enough to use means for getting
it abolished. And though most legislators have not sufficient
penetration to perceive that the greater part of the
evils which they attempt to cure by official inspection and
regulation, would disappear were there a certain, prompt,
and cheap ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice; yet the County-Courts-Act
and other recent law-reforms, show that they do
eventually recognize the importance
of more efficient <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span>
judicial arrangements. While, therefore, the lower average
of intelligence which necessarily characterizes rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government, unfits it for discharging the complex business
of regulating the entire national life; it does not unfit it for
discharging the comparatively simple duties of protector.
Again, in respect of this all-essential function of a government,
there is a much clearer identity of interest between
rep­re­sen­ta­tive and citizen, than in respect of the multitudinous
other functions which governments undertake.
Though it is generally of but little consequence to the member
of Parliament whether state-teachers, state-preachers,
state-officers of health, state-dispensers of charity, etc., do
their work well, it is of great consequence to him that life
and property should be secure; and hence he is more likely
to care for the efficient ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice than for
the efficient ad­min­i­stra­tion of anything else. Moreover, the
complexity, incongruity of parts, and general cumbrousness
which deprive a rep­re­sen­ta­tive government of that activity
and decision required for paternally-superintending the
affairs of thirty millions of citizens; do not deprive it of the
ability to establish and maintain the regulations by which
these citizens are prevented from trespassing against one
another. For the principles of equity are permanent as well
as simple; and once having been legally embodied in their
chief outlines, all that devolves on a government is to develop
them more perfectly, and improve the appliances for enforcing
them: an undertaking for which the slow and involved
action of a rep­re­sen­ta­tive government does not unfit it. So
that while by its origin, theory, and results, rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government is shown to be the best for securing justice
between class and class, as well as between man and man,
the objections which so strongly tell against it in all its
other relations to society, do not tell against it in this
fundamental relation.</p>

<p>Thus, then, we reach the solution of the paradox. Here is
the reconciliation between
the two seemingly-contradictory <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
positions awhile since taken. To the question—What is
rep­re­sen­ta­tive government good for? our reply is—It is
good, especially good, good above all others, for doing the
thing which a government should do. It is bad, especially
bad, bad above all others, for doing the things which a
government should not do.</p>

<p class="padtopb">One point remains. We said, some distance back, that
not only may rep­re­sen­ta­tive government be the best, notwithstanding
its many conspicuous deficiencies; but that it is
even possible to discern in these very deficiencies further
proofs of its superiority. The conclusion just arrived at,
implying, as it does, that these deficiencies tend to hinder it
from doing the things which no government should do, has
already furnished a key to this strange-looking assertion.
But it will be well here to make a more specific justification
of it. This brings us to the pure science of the matter.</p>

<p>The ever-increasing complexity which characterizes advancing
societies, is a complexity that results from the
multiplication of different parts performing different duties.
The doctrine of the division of labour is now-a-days understood
by most to some extent; and most know that by
this division of labour each operative, each manufacturer,
each town, each district, is constantly more and more
restricted to one kind of work. Those who study the
organization of living bodies find the uniform process
of development to be, that each organ gradually acquires a
definite and limited function: there arises, step by step,
a more perfect “physiological division of labour.” And
in an article on “Progress: its Law and Cause,” published
in our April number, we pointed out that this increasing
specialization of functions which goes on in all organized
bodies, social as well as individual, is one of the manifestations
of a still more general process pervading creation,
inorganic as well as organic.</p>

<p>Now this specialization of functions, which is
the law of <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span>
all organization, has a twofold implication. At the same
time that each part grows adapted to the particular duty
it has to discharge, it grows unadapted to all other duties.
The becoming especially fit for one thing, is a becoming
less fit than before for everything else. We have not
space here to exemplify this truth. Any modern work
on physiology, however, will furnish the reader with
abundant illustrations of it, as exhibited in the evolution
of living creatures; and as exhibited in the evolution of
societies, it may be studied in the writings of political
economists. All which we wish here to point out is, that
the governmental part of the body politic exemplifies this
truth equally with its other parts. In virtue of this
universal law, a government cannot gain ability to perform
its special work without losing such ability as it had to
perform other work.</p>

<p>This then is, as we say, the pure science of the matter.
The original and essential office of a government is that of
protecting its subjects against aggression external and
internal. In low, undeveloped forms of society, where
yet there is but little dif­fer­en­tia­tion of parts, and little
specialization of functions, this essential work, discharged
with extreme imperfection, is joined with endless other
work: the government has a controlling action over all
conduct, individual and social—regulates dress, food,
ablutions, prices, trade, religion—exercises unbounded
power. In becoming so constituted as to discharge better
its essential function, the government becomes more limited
alike in the power and the habit of doing other things.
Increasing ability to perform its true duty, involves
decreasing ability to perform all other kinds of actions.
And this conclusion, deducible from the universal law of
organization, is the conclusion to which inductive reasoning
has already led us. We have seen that, whether considered
in theory or practice, rep­re­sen­ta­tive government is the
best for securing justice. We have also
seen that, whether <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
considered in theory or practice, it is the worst for all
other purposes. And here we find that this last characteristic
is a necessary accompaniment of the first. These
various incapacities, which seem to tell so seriously against
the goodness of rep­re­sen­ta­tive government, are but the
inevitable consequences of its more complete adaptation
to its proper work; and, so understood, are themselves
indications that it is the form of government natural to a
more highly-organized and advanced social state.</p>

<p>We do not expect this consideration to weigh much
with those whom it most concerns. Truths of so abstract
a character find no favour with senates. The metamorphosis
we have described is not mentioned in Ovid.
History, as at present written, makes no comments on it.
There is nothing about it to be found in blue-books and
committee-reports. Neither is it proved by statistics.
Evidently, then, it has but small chance of recognition by
the “practical” legislator. But to the select few who
study the Social Science, properly so called, we commend
this general fact as one of the highest significance. Those
who know something of the general laws of life, and who
perceive that these general laws of life underlie all social
phenomena, will see that this dual change in the character
of advanced governments, involves an answer to the first
of all political questions. They will see that this specialization
in virtue of which an advanced government gains
power to perform one function, while it loses power to
perform others, clearly indicates the true limitations of
State-duty. They will see that, even leaving out all other
evidence, this fact alone shows conclusively what is the
proper sphere of legislation.</p>

<p>Among unmitigated rogues, mutual trust is impossible.
Among people of absolute integrity, mutual trust would be
unlimited. These are truisms. Given a nation made up of
liars and thieves, and all trade among its members must be
carried on either by barter or by a currency of intrinsic value:
nothing in the shape of <i>promises</i>-to-pay can pass in place of
<i>actual</i> payments; for, by the hypothesis, such promises
being never fulfilled, will not be taken. On the other
hand, given a nation of perfectly honest men—men as
careful of others’ rights as of their own—and nearly all
trade among its members may be carried on by memoranda
of debts and claims, eventually written off against one
another in the books of bankers; seeing that as, by the
hypothesis, no man will ever issue more memoranda of
debts than his goods and his claims will liquidate, his
paper will pass current for whatever it represents. Coin
will be needed only as a measure of value, and to facilitate
those small transactions for which it is physically the most
convenient. These we take to be self-evident truths.</p>

<p>From them follows the corollary that in a nation neither
wholly honest nor wholly dishonest, there may, and eventually
will, be established a
mixed currency—a currency <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
partly of intrinsic value and partly of credit-value. The
ratio between the quantities of these two kinds of currency,
will be determined by a combination of several causes.</p>

<p>Supposing that there is no legislative meddling to disturb
the natural balance, it is clear from what has already been
said, that, fundamentally, the proportion of coin to paper
will depend on the average con­scien­tious­ness of the people.
Daily experience must ever be teaching each citizen, which
other citizens he can put confidence in, and which not.
Daily experience must also ever be teaching him how far
this confidence may be carried. From personal experiment,
and from current opinion, which results from the experiments
of others, every one must learn, more or less truly, what credit
may safely be given. If all find that their neighbours are
little to be trusted, but few promises-to-pay will circulate.
And the circulation of promises-to-pay will be great, if all
find that the fulfilment of trading engagements is tolerably
certain. The degree of <i>honesty</i> characterizing a community,
being the first regulator of a credit-currency; the second is
the degree of <i>prudence</i>. Other things equal, it is manifest
that among a sanguine, speculative people, promissory
payments will be taken more readily, and will therefore
circulate more largely, than among a cautious people. Two
men having exactly the same experiences of mercantile
risks will, under the same circumstances, respectively give
credit and refuse it, if they are respectively rash and
circumspect. And two nations thus contrasted in prudence,
will be similarly contrasted in the relative quantities of
notes and bills in circulation among them. Nay, they will
be more than similarly contrasted in this respect; seeing
that the prevailing incautiousness, besides making each
citizen unduly ready to give credit, will also produce in him
an undue readiness to risk his own capital in speculations,
and a consequent undue demand for credit from other
citizens. There will be both an increased pressure for
credit and a diminished resistance; and
therefore a more <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
than proportionate excess of paper-currency. Of this
national characteristic and its consequences, we have a
conspicuous example in the United States.</p>

<p>To these comparatively permanent moral causes, on which
the ordinary ratio of hypothetical to real money in a community
depends, have to be added certain temporary moral
and physical causes, which produce temporary variations in
the ratio. The prudence of any people is liable to more or
less fluctuation. In railway-manias and the like, we see
that irrational expectations may spread through a whole
nation, and lead its members to give and take credit almost
recklessly. But the chief causes of temporary variations are
those which directly affect the quantity of available capital.
Wars, deficient harvests, or losses consequent on the misfortunes
of other nations, will, by impoverishing the
community, inevitably lead to an increase in the ratio of
<i>promissory payments to actual payments</i>. For what must be
done by the citizen disabled by such causes from meeting his
engagements?—the shopkeeper whose custom has fallen off
in consequence of the high price of bread; or the manufacturer
whose goods lie in his ware-rooms unsaleable; or
the merchant whose foreign correspondents fail him? As
the proceeds of his business do not suffice to liquidate the
claims on him that are falling due, he is compelled either to
find other means of liquidating them, or to stop payment.
Rather than stop payment, he will, of course, make
temporary sacrifices—will give high terms to whoever will
furnish him with the desired means. If, by depositing
securities with his banker, he can get a loan at an advanced
rate of interest, well. If not, by offering an adequate
temptation, he may mortgage his property to some one
having good credit; who either gives bills, or draws on his
banker for the sum agreed to. In either case, extra
promises to pay are issued; or, if the difficulty is met by
accommodation-bills, the same result follows. And in proportion
to the number of citizens obliged to
resort to one <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
or other of these expedients, must be the increase of
promissory payments in circulation.</p>

<p>Reduce this proposition to its most general terms, and
it becomes self-evident. Thus:—All bank-notes, cheques,
bills of exchange, etc., are so many <i>memoranda of claims</i>.
No matter what may be the technical distinctions among
them, on which upholders of the “currency principle” seek
to establish their dogma, they all come within this definition.
Under the ordinary state of things, the amount of
available wealth in the hands, or at the command, of those
concerned, suffices to meet these claims as they are severally
presented for payment; and they are paid either by equivalents
of intrinsic value, as coin, or by giving in place of
them other memoranda of claims on some body of undoubted
solvency. But now let the amount of available wealth in
the hands of the community be greatly diminished. Suppose
a large portion of the necessaries of life, or of coin, which
is the most exchangeable equivalent of such necessaries,
has been sent abroad to support an army, or to subsidize
foreign states; or, suppose that there has been a failure in
the crops of grain or potatoes. What follows? It follows
that part of the claims cannot be liquidated. And what
must happen from their non-liquidation? It must happen
that those unable to liquidate them will either fail, or they
will redeem them by directly or indirectly giving in exchange
certain memoranda of claims on their stock-in-trade,
houses, or land. That is, such of these claims as the
deficient <i>floating</i> capital does not suffice to meet, are replaced
by claims on <i>fixed</i> capital. The memoranda of
claims which should have <i>dis</i>appeared by liquidation, <i>re</i>-appear
in a new form; and the quantity of paper-currency
is increased. If the war, famine, or other cause of impoverishment,
continues, the process is repeated. Those who
have no further fixed capital to mortgage, become bankrupt;
while those whose fixed capital admits of it, mortgage
still further, and still further
increase the promissory <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
payments in circulation. Manifestly, if the members of a
community whose annual returns but little more than suffice
to meet their annual payments suddenly lose part of their
annual returns, they must become proportionately in debt
to one another; and the documents expressive of debt must
be proportionately multiplied.</p>

<p>This <i>a priori</i> conclusion is in perfect harmony with mercantile
experience. The last hundred years have furnished
repeated illustrations of its truth. After the enormous
export of gold in 1795–6 for war-loans to Germany, and to
meet bills drawn on the Treasury by British agents abroad;
and after large advances made under a moral compulsion
by the Bank of England to the Government; there followed
an excessive issue of bank-notes. In 1796–7, there were
failures of the provincial banks; a panic in London; a run
on the nearly-exhausted Bank of England; and a suspension
of cash-payments—a State-authorized refusal to redeem
promises to pay. In 1800, the further impoverishment
consequent on a bad harvest, joined with the legalized
in­con­ver­ti­bil­ity of bank-notes, entailed so great a multiplication
of them as to cause their depreciation. During the
temporary peace of 1802, the country partly recovered
itself; and the Bank of England would have liquidated
the claims on it had the Government allowed. On the
subsequent resumption of war, the phenomenon was repeated;
as in later times it has been on each occasion when
the community, carried away by irrational hopes, has locked
up an undue proportion of its capital in permanent works.
Moreover, we have still more conclusive illustrations—illustrations
of the sudden cessation of commercial distress
and bankruptcy, resulting from a sudden increase of credit-circulation.
When, in 1793, there came a general crash,
mainly due to an unsafe banking-system which had grown
up in the provinces <i>in consequence</i> of the Bank of England
monopoly—when the pressure, extending to London, became
so great as to alarm the Bank-directors
and to cause <span class="xxpn" id="p331">{331}</span>
them suddenly to restrict their issues, thereby producing a
frightful multiplication of bankruptcies; the Government
(to mitigate an evil indirectly produced by legislation)
determined to issue Exchequer-Bills to such as could give
adequate security. That is, they allowed hard-pressed
citizens to mortgage their fixed capitals for equivalents of
State-promises to pay, with which to liquidate the demands
on them. The effect was magical. £2,202,000 only of
Exchequer-Bills were required. The consciousness that
loans could be had, in many cases prevented them from
being needed. The panic quickly subsided; and all the
loans were very soon repaid. In 1825, again, when the
Bank of England, after having intensified a panic by extreme
restriction of its issues, suddenly changed its policy, and in
four days advanced £5,000,000 notes on all sorts of securities,
the panic at once ceased.</p>

<p>And now, mark two important truths. As just implied,
those expansions of paper-circulation which naturally take
place in times of impoverishment or commercial difficulty,
are highly salutary. This issuing of securities for future
payment when there does not exist the wherewith for
immediate payment, is a means of mitigating national
disasters. The process amounts to a postponement of
trading-engagements which cannot at once be met. And the
alternative questions to be asked respecting it are—Shall
all the merchants, manufacturers, shopkeepers, etc., who,
by unwise investments, or war, or famine, or great losses
abroad, have been in part deprived of the means of meeting
the claims upon them, be allowed to mortgage their fixed
capital? or, by being debarred from issuing memoranda of
claims on their fixed capital, shall they be made bankrupts?
On the one hand, if they are permitted to avail themselves
of that credit which their fellow-citizens willingly give
them on the strength of the proffered securities, most of
them will tide over their difficulties; and in virtue of that
accumulation of surplus capital ever going on,
they will be <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
able, by-and-by, to liquidate their debts in full. On the
other hand, if they are forthwith bankrupted, carrying
with them others, and these again others, there follows a
disastrous loss to all the creditors: property to an immense
amount being peremptorily sold at a time when there can be
comparatively few able to buy, must go at a great sacrifice;
and those who in a year or two would have been paid in
full, must be content with 10<i>s.</i> in the pound. Added to
which evil comes the still greater one—an extensive damage
to the organization of society. Numerous importing, producing,
and distributing establishments are swept away;
tens of thousands of their dependents are left without
work; and before the industrial fabric can be repaired, a
long time must elapse, much labour must lie idle, and great
distress be borne. Between these alternatives, who, then,
can pause? Let this spontaneous remedial process follow
its own course, and the evil will either be in great measure
eventually escaped, or will be spread little by little over a
considerable period. Stop this remedial process, and the
whole evil, falling at once on society, will bring wide-spread
ruin and misery.</p>

<p>The second of these important truths is, that an expanded
circulation of promises to pay, caused by absolute or
relative impoverishment, contracts to its normal limits as
fast as the need for expansion disappears. For the conditions
of the case imply that all who have mortgaged their
fixed capitals to obtain the means of meeting their engagements,
have done so on unfavourable terms; and are
therefore under a strong stimulus to pay off their mortgages
as quickly as possible. Every one who, at a time of commercial
pressure, gets a loan from a bank, has to give high
interest. Hence, as fast as prosperity returns, and his
profits accumulate, he gladly escapes this heavy tax by
repaying the loan; in doing which he, directly or indirectly,
takes back to the bank as large a number of its credit
documents as he originally received, and
so diminishes the <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
credit-circulation as much as his original transaction had
increased it. Considered apart from technical distinctions,
a banker performs, in such case, the function of an agent
in whose name traders issue negotiable memoranda of claims
on their estates. The agent is already known to the public
as one who issues memoranda of claims on capital that is
partly floating and partly fixed—memoranda of claims that
have an established character, and are convenient in their
amounts. What the agent does under the circumstances
specified, is to issue more such memoranda of claims, on the
security of more fixed, and partially-fixed, capital put in his
possession. His clients hypothecate their estates through
the banker, instead of doing it in their own names, simply
because of the facilities which he has and which they have
not. And as the banker requires to be paid for his agency
and his risk, his clients redeem their estates, and close these
special transactions with him, as quickly as they can: thereby
diminishing the amount of credit-currency.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the balance of a mixed currency of
voluntary origin is, under all circumstances, self-adjusting.
Supposing considerations of physical convenience out of the
question, the average ratio of paper to coin is primarily
dependent on the average trustworthiness of the people,
and secondarily dependent on their average prudence.
When, in consequence of unusual prosperity, there is an
unusual increase in the number of mercantile transactions,
there is a corresponding increase in the quantity of currency,
both metallic and paper, to meet the requirement. And
when from war, famine, or over-investment, the available
wealth in the hands of citizens is insufficient to pay
their debts to one another, the memoranda of debts in
circulation acquire an increased ratio to the quantity of
gold: to decrease again as fast as the excess of debts can
be liquidated.</p>

<p>That these self-regulating processes act but imperfectly,
is doubtless true. With an imperfect
humanity, they cannot <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
act otherwise than imperfectly. People who are dishonest,
or rash, or stupid, will inevitably suffer the penalties of dishonesty,
or rashness, or stupidity. If any think that by
some patent legislative mechanism, a society of bad citizens
can be made to work together as well as a society of good
ones, we shall not take pains to show them the contrary.
If any think that the dealings of men deficient in uprightness
and foresight, may be so regulated by cunningly-devised
Acts of Parliament as to secure the effects of
uprightness and foresight, we have nothing to say to them.
Or if there are any (and we fear there are numbers) who
think that in times of commercial difficulty, resulting from
impoverishment or other natural causes, the evil can be
staved-off by some ministerial sleight of hand, we despair
of convincing them that the thing is impossible. See it or
not, the truth is that the State can do none of these things.
As we shall show, the State can, and sometimes does, <i>produce</i>
commercial disasters. As we shall also show, it can,
and sometimes does, <i>exacerbate</i> the commercial disasters
otherwise produced. But while it can create and can make
worse, it cannot prevent.</p>

<p>All which the State has to do in the matter is to discharge
its ordinary office—to administer justice. The enforcement
of contracts is one of the functions included in its general
function of maintaining the rights of citizens. And among
other contracts which it is called on to enforce, are the
contracts expressed in credit-documents—bills of exchange,
cheques, bank-notes. If any one issues a promise-to-pay,
either on demand or at specified date, and does not fulfil
that promise, the State, when appealed to by the creditor,
is bound in its protective capacity to obtain fulfilment of
the promise, at whatever cost to the debtor, or such partial
fulfilment of it as his effects suffice for. The State’s duty
in the case of the currency, as in other cases, is sternly to
threaten the penalty of bankruptcy on all who make engagements
which they cannot meet, and sternly
to inflict the <span class="xxpn" id="p335">{335}</span>
penalty when called on by those aggrieved. If it falls short
of this, mischief ensues. If it exceeds this, mischief ensues.
Let us glance at the facts.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Had we space to trace in detail the history of the Bank of
England—to show how the privileges contained in its first
charter were bribes given by a distressed Government in
want of a large loan—how, soon afterwards, the law which
forbad a partnership of more than six persons from becoming
bankers, was passed to prevent the issue of notes by the
South-Sea Company, and so to preserve the Bank-monopoly—how
the continuance of State-favours to the Bank, corresponded
with the continuance of the Bank’s claims on the
State; we should see that, from the first, banking-legislation
has been an organized injustice. But passing over earlier
periods, let us begin with the events that closed the last
century. Our rulers of that day had entered into a war—whether
with adequate reason needs not here be discussed.
They had lent vast sums in gold to their allies. They had
demanded large advances from the Bank of England, which
the Bank durst not refuse. They had thus necessitated an
excessive issue of notes by the Bank. That is, they had so
greatly diminished the floating capital of the community,
that engagements could not be met; and an immense
number of promises-to-pay took the place of actual payments.
Soon after, the fulfilment of these promises became
so difficult that it was forbidden by law; that is, cash-payments
were suspended. Now for these results—for the
national impoverishment and consequent abnormal condition
of the currency, the State was responsible. How much of
the blame lay with the governing classes and how much
with the nation at large, we do not pretend to say. What
it concerns us here to note is, that the calamity arose from
the acts of the ruling power. When, again, in 1802, after
a short peace, the available capital of the community had so
far increased that the redemption
of promises-to-pay became <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
possible, and the Bank of England was anxious to begin
redeeming them, the legislature interposed its veto; and so
continued the evils of an inconvertible paper-currency after
they would naturally have ceased. Still more disastrous,
however, were the results that by-and-by ensued from State-meddlings.
Cash-payments having been suspended—the
Government, instead of enforcing all contracts, having temporarily
cancelled a great part of them, by saying to every
banker, “You shall not be called on to liquidate in coin the
promises-to-pay which you issue;” the natural checks to
the multiplication of promises-to-pay, disappeared. What
followed? Banks being no longer required to cash their
notes in coin; and easily obtaining from the Bank of England,
supplies of its notes in exchange for fixed securities;
were ready to make advances to almost any extent. Not
being obliged to raise their rate of discount in consequence
of the diminution of their available capital; and reaping a
profit by every loan (of notes) made on fixed capital; there
arose both an abnormal facility of borrowing, and an abnormal
desire to lend. Thus were fostered the wild speculations
of 1809—speculations that were not only thus
fostered, but were in great measure <i>caused</i> by the previous
over-issue of notes; which, by further exaggerating the
natural rise of prices, increased the apparent profitableness
of investments. And all this, be it remembered, took
place at a time when there should have been rigid economy—at
a time of impoverishment consequent on continued
war—at a time when, but for law-produced illusions, there
would have been commercial straitness and a corresponding
carefulness. Just when its indebtedness was unusually
great, the community was induced still further to increase
its indebtedness. Clearly, then, the progressive accumulation
and depreciation of promises-to-pay, and the commercial
disasters which finally resulted from it in 1814–15–16,
when ninety provincial banks were broken and
more dissolved, were State-produced evils:
partly due to <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
a war which, whether necessary or not, was carried on by
the Government, and greatly exacerbated by the currency-regulations
which that Government had made.</p>

<p>Before passing to more recent facts, let us parenthetically
notice the similarly-caused degradation of the
currency which had previously arisen in Ireland. When
examined by a parliamentary committee in 1804, Mr.
Colville, one of the directors of the Bank of Ireland, stated
that before the passing of the Irish Bank-Restriction-Bill
(the bill by which cash-payments were suspended) the
directors habitually met any unusual demand for gold by
diminishing their issues. That is to say, in the ordinary
course of business, they raised their rate of discount whenever
the demand enabled them; and so, both increased
their profits and warded-off the danger of bankruptcy.
During this unregulated period their note-circulation was
between £600,000 and £700,000. But as soon as they
were guaranteed by law against the danger of bankruptcy,
their circulation began rapidly to increase; and very soon
reached £3,000,000. The results, as proved before the
committee, were these:—The exchange with England
became greatly depressed; nearly all the good specie was
exported to England; it was replaced in Dublin (where
small notes could not be issued) by a base coinage,
adulterated to the extent of fifty per cent.; and elsewhere
it was replaced by notes payable at twenty-one days’ date,
issued by all sorts of persons, for sums down even as low
as sixpence. And this excessive multiplication of small
notes was <i>necessitated</i> by the impossibility of otherwise
carrying on retail trade, after the disappearance of the
silver coinage. For these disastrous effects, then, legislation
was responsible. The swarms of “silver-notes”
resulted from the exportation of silver; the exportation of
silver was due to the great depression of the exchange
with England; this great depression arose from the
excessive issue of notes by the Bank of
Ireland; and this <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span>
excessive issue followed from their legalized in­con­ver­ti­bil­ity.
Yet, though these facts were long ago established
by a committee of the House of Commons, the defenders
of the “currency-principle” are actually blind enough to
cite this multiplication of sixpenny promises-to-pay, <i>as
proving the evils of an unregulated currency</i>!</p>

<p>Returning now to the case of the Bank of England, let
us pass at once to the Act of 1844. While still a protectionist—while
still a believer in the beneficence of law
as a controller of commerce—Sir Robert Peel undertook to
stop the recurrence of monetary crises, like those of 1825,
1836, and 1839. Overlooking the truth that, when not
<i>caused</i> by the meddlings of legislators, a monetary crisis is
due, either to an absolute impoverishment, or to a relative
impoverishment consequent on speculative over-investment;
and that for the bad season, or the imprudence, causing
this, there is no remedy; he boldly proclaimed that “<i>it is
better to prevent the paroxysm than to excite it</i>:” and he
brought forward the Bank-Act of 1844 as the means of
prevention. How merciless has been Nature’s criticism on
this remnant of Protectionism, we all know. The monetary
sliding-scale has been as great a failure as its prototype.
Within three years arose one of these crises which were to
have been prevented. Within another ten years has arisen
a second of these crises. And on both occasions this
intended safeguard has so intensified the evil, that a
temporary repeal of it has been imperative.</p>

<p>We should have thought that, even without facts,
every one might have seen that it is impossible, by Act of
Parliament, to prevent imprudent people from doing imprudent
things; and, if facts were needed, we should have
thought that our commercial history up to 1844 supplied a
sufficiency. But a superstitious faith in State-ordinances disregards
such facts. And we doubt not that even now, though
there have been two glaring failures of this professed check
on over-speculation—though
the evidence conclusively <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span>
shows that the late commercial catastrophes have had
nothing whatever to do with the issue of bank-notes, but,
as in the case of the Western Bank of Scotland, occurred
along with diminished issues—and though in Hamburg,
where the “currency principle” has been rigidly carried
out to the very letter, there has been a worse crisis than
anywhere else; yet there will remain plenty of believers in
the efficiency of Sir R. Peel’s prophylactic.</p>

<p>But, as already said, the measure has not only failed; it
has made worse the panics it was to have warded-off.
And it was sure to do this. As shown at the outset, the
multiplication of promises-to-pay that occurs at a period of
impoverishment caused by war, famine, over-investment, or
losses abroad, is a salutary process of mitigation—is a
mode of postponing actual payments till actual payments
are possible—is a preventive of wholesale bankruptcy—is
a spontaneous act of self-preservation. We pointed out,
not only that this is an <i>a priori</i> conclusion, but that facts
in our own mercantile history illustrate at once the naturalness,
the benefits, the necessity of it. And if this conclusion
needs enforcing by further evidence, we have it in the recent
events at Hamburg. In that city, there are no notes in
circulation but such as are represented by actual equivalents
of bullion or jewels in the bank: no one is allowed, as with
us, to obtain bank-promises-to-pay in return for securities.
Hence it resulted that when the Hamburg merchants,
lacking their remittances from abroad, were suddenly
deprived of the wherewith to meet their engagements; and
were prevented by law from getting bank-promises-to-pay
by pawning their estates; bankruptcy swept them away
wholesale. And what finally happened? To prevent
universal ruin, the Government was obliged to decree that
all bills of exchange coming due, should have a month’s
grace; and that there should be immediately formed a
State-Discount-Bank—an office for issuing State-promises-to-pay
in return for securities. That is, having
first by its <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span>
restrictive law ruined a host of merchants, the Government
was obliged to legalize that postponement of payments
which, but for its law, would have spontaneously taken
place. With such further confirmation of an <i>a priori</i>
conclusion, can it be doubted that our late commercial
difficulties were intensified by the measure of 1844? Is it
not, indeed, notorious in the City, that the progressively-increasing
demand for accommodation, was in great part
due to the conviction that, in consequence of the Bank-Act,
there would shortly be no accommodation at all? Does not
every London merchant know that his neighbours who had
bills coming due, and who saw that by the time they were
due the Bank would discount only at still higher rates,
or not at all, decided to lay in beforehand the means of
meeting those bills? Is it not an established fact that the
hoarding thus induced, not only rendered the pressure on
the Bank greater than it would otherwise have been, but,
by taking both gold and notes out of circulation, made the
Bank’s issues temporarily useless to the general public?
Did it not happen in this case, as in 1793 and 1825, that
when at last restriction was removed, the mere consciousness
that loans could be had, itself prevented them from
being required? And, indeed, is not the simple fact that
the panic quickly subsided when the Act was suspended,
sufficient proof that the Act had, in great measure,
produced it.</p>

<p>See, then, for what we have to thank legislative meddling.
During ordinary times Sir R. Peel’s Act, by obliging the
Bank of England, and occasionally provincial banks, to
keep more gold than they would otherwise have kept (and
if it has not done this it has done nothing), has inflicted a
tax on the nation to the extent of the interest on such
portion of the gold-currency as was in excess of the need:
a tax which, in the course of the last thirteen years, has
probably amounted to some millions. And then, on the two
occasions when there have arisen the crises
that were to <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
have been prevented, the Act, after having intensified the
pressure, made bankrupt a great number of respectable
firms which would else have stood, and increased the
distress not only of the trading but of the working population,
has been twice abandoned at the moment when its
beneficence was to have been conspicuous. It has been
a cost, a mischief, and a failure. Yet such is the
prevailing delusion that, judging from appearances, it will
be maintained!</p>

<p>“But,” ask our opponents, “shall the Bank be allowed
to let gold drain out of the country without check? Shall
it have permission to let its reserve of gold diminish so
greatly as to risk the convertibility of its notes? Shall it
be enabled recklessly to increase its issues, and so produce
a depreciated paper-currency?”</p>

<p>Really, in these Free-trade days, it seems strange to have
to answer questions like these; and, were it not for the confusion
of facts and ideas which legislation has produced, it
would be inexcusable to ask them.</p>

<p>In the first place, the common notion that the draining of
gold out of the country is intrinsically, and in all cases, an
evil, is nothing but a political superstition—a superstition in
part descended from the antique fallacy that money is the
only wealth, and in part from the maxims of an artificial,
law-produced state of things, under which the exportation of
gold really <i>was</i> a sign of a corrupted currency: we mean,
during the suspension of cash-payments. Law having cancelled
millions of contracts which it was its duty to enforce—law
having absolved bankers from liquidating their
promises-to-pay in coin, having rendered it needless to keep
a stock of coin with which to liquidate them, and having
thus taken away that natural check which prevents the
over-issue and depreciation of notes—law having partly
suspended that <i>home</i> demand for gold which ordinarily
competes with and balances the <i>foreign</i> demand; there
resulted an abnormal exportation of
gold. By-and-by it <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
was seen that this efflux of gold was a consequence of the
over-issue of notes; and that the ac­com­pa­ny­ing high price
of gold, as paid for in notes, proved the depreciation of
notes. And then it became an established doctrine that an
adverse state of the foreign exchanges, indicating a drain of
gold, was significant of an excessive circulation of notes;
and that the issue of notes should be regulated by the state
of the exchanges.</p>

<p>This unnatural condition of the currency having continued
for a quarter of a century, the concomitant doctrine rooted
itself in the general mind. And now mark one of the multitudinous
evils of legislative meddling. This artificial test,
good only for an artificial state, has survived the return to a
natural state; and men’s ideas about currency have been
reduced by it to chronic confusion.</p>

<p>The truth is that while, during a legalized in­con­ver­ti­bil­ity
of bank-notes, an efflux of gold may, and often does, indicate
an excessive issue of bank-notes; under ordinary circumstances
an efflux of gold has little or nothing to do with the
issue of bank-notes, but is determined by merely mercantile
causes. And the truth is that far from being an evil, an
efflux of gold thus brought about by mercantile causes, is a
good. Leaving out of the question, as of course we must,
such exportations of gold as take place for the support
of armies abroad; the cause of efflux is either an actual
plethora of all commodities, gold included, which results
in gold being sent out of the country for the purpose of
foreign investment; or else an abundance of gold as
compared with other leading commodities. And while, in
this last case, the efflux of gold indicates some absolute
or relative impoverishment of the nation, it is a means of
mitigating the bad consequences of that impoverishment.
Consider the question as one of political economy, and
this truth becomes obvious. Thus:—The nation habitually
requires for use and consumption certain quantities of
commodities, of which gold is
one. These commodities <span class="xxpn" id="p343">{343}</span>
are severally and collectively liable to fall short; either
from deficient harvests, from waste in war, from losses
abroad, or from too great a diversion of labour or capital
in some special direction. When a scarcity of some chief
commodity or necessary occurs, what is the remedy? The
commodity of which there is an excess (or if none is in
excess, then that which can best be spared) is exported
in exchange for an additional supply of the deficient
commodity. And, indeed, the whole of our foreign trade,
alike in ordinary and extraordinary times, consists in this
process. But when it happens either that the commodity
which we can best spare is not wanted abroad; or (as
recently) that a chief foreign customer is temporarily
disabled from buying; or that the commodity which we
can best spare is gold; then gold itself is exported in
exchange for the thing which we most want. Whatever
form the transaction takes, it is nothing but bringing the
supplies of various commodities into harmony with the
demands for them. The fact that gold is exported, is
simply a proof that the need for gold is less than the need
for other things. Under such circumstances an efflux of
gold will continue, and <i>ought</i> to continue, until other
things have become relatively so abundant, and gold
relatively so scarce, that the demand for gold is equal to
other demands. And he who would prevent this process,
is about as wise as the miser who, finding his house
without food, chooses to starve rather than draw upon
his purse.</p>

<p>The second question—“Shall the Bank have permission
to let its reserve of gold diminish so greatly as to risk the
convertibility of its notes?” is not more profound than
the first. It may fitly be answered by the more general
question—“Shall the merchant, the manufacturer, or the
shopkeeper, be allowed so to invest his capital as to risk
the fulfilment of his engagements?” If the answer to the
first be “No,” it must be “No” to the second.
If to the <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
second it be “Yes,” it must be “Yes” to the first. Any
one who proposed that the State should oversee the
transactions of every trader, so as to insure his ability to
cash all demands as they fell due, might with consistency
argue that bankers should be under like control. But
while no one has the folly to contend for the one, nearly
all contend for the other. One would think that the
banker acquired, in virtue of his occupation, some abnormal
desire to ruin himself—that while traders in other things
are restrained by a wholesome dread of bankruptcy, traders
in capital have a longing to appear in the <i>Gazette</i>, which
law alone can prevent them from gratifying! Surely the
moral checks which act on other men will act on bankers.
And if these moral checks do not suffice to produce perfect
security, we have ample proof that no cunning legislative
checks will supply their place. The current notion that
bankers can, and will, if allowed, issue notes to any extent,
is one of the absurdest illusions—an illusion, however,
which would never have arisen but for the vicious over-issues
induced by law. The truth is that, in the first
place, a banker <i>cannot</i> increase his issue of notes at will.
It has been proved by the unanimous testimony of all
bankers who have been examined before successive parliamentary
committees, that “the amount of their issues is
exclusively regulated by the extent of local dealings and
expenditure in their respective districts;” and that any
notes issued in excess of the demand are “immediately
returned to them.” And the truth is, in the second place,
that a banker <i>will not</i>, on the average of cases, issue
more notes than in his judgment it is safe to issue; seeing
that if his promises-to-pay in circulation, are much in
excess of his available means of paying them, he runs a
great risk of having to stop payment—a result of which he
has no less a horror than other men. If facts are needed
in proof of this, they are furnished by the history of both
the Bank of England and the Bank
of Ireland; which, <span class="xxpn" id="p345">{345}</span>
before they were debauched by the State, habitually regulated
their issues according to their stock of bullion, and
would probably always have been still more careful but for
the consciousness that there was the State-credit to fall
back upon.</p>

<p>The third question—“Shall the Bank be allowed to issue
notes in such numbers as to cause their depreciation?”
has, in effect, been answered in answering the first two.
There can be no depreciation of notes so long as they are
exchangeable for gold on demand. And so long as the
State, in discharge of its duty, insists on the fulfilment of
contracts, the alternative of bankruptcy must ever be a
restraint on such over-issue of notes as endangers that
exchangeability. The bugbear of depreciation is one that
would have been unknown but for the sins of governments.
In the case of America, where there have been occasional
depreciations, the sin has been a sin of omission: the State
has not enforced the fulfilment of contracts—has not forthwith
bankrupted those who failed to cash their notes; and,
if accounts are true, has allowed those to be mobbed who
brought back far-wandering notes for payment.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn35" id="fnanch35">35</a>
In all
other cases the sin has been a sin of commission. The
depreciated paper-currency in France, during the revolution,
was a State-currency. The depreciated paper-currencies
of Austria and Russia have been State-currencies. And
the only depreciated paper-currency we have known, has
been to all intents and purposes a State-currency. It was
the State which, in 1795–6, <i>forced</i> upon the Bank of England
that excessive issue of notes which led to the suspension of
cash-payments. It was the State which, in 1802, <i>forbad</i>
the resumption of cash-payments, when the Bank of England
wished to resume them. It was the State which,
during a quarter of a century, <i>maintained</i> that suspension
of cash-payments from which the excessive multiplication
and depreciation of notes resulted.
The entire corruption <span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span>
was entailed by State-expenditure, and established by
State-warrant. Yet now the State affects a virtuous
horror of the crime committed at its instigation! Having
contrived to shuffle-off the odium on to the shoulders of its
tools, the State gravely lectures the banking-community
upon its guilt; and with sternest face passes measures to
prevent it from sinning!</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch35" id="fn35">35</a>
This was written in 1858; when
“greenbacks” were unknown.</p></div>

<p>We contend, then, that neither to restrain the efflux of
gold, nor to guard against the over-issue of bank-notes,
is legislative interference warranted. If Government will
promptly execute the law against all defaulters, the self-interest
of bankers and traders will do the rest: such evils
as would still result from mercantile dishonesties and
imprudences, being evils which legal regulation may
augment but cannot prevent. Let the Bank of England,
in common with every other bank, simply consult its own
safety and its own profits; and there will result just as
much check as should be put, on the efflux of gold or the
circulation of paper; and the only check that can be put
on the doings of speculators. Whatever leads to unusual
draughts on the resources of banks, immediately causes a
rise in the rate of discount—a rise dictated both by the
wish to make increased profits, and the wish to avoid a
dangerous decrease of resources. This raised rate of
discount prevents the demand from being so great as it
would else have been—alike checks undue expansion of the
note-circulation; stops speculators from making further
engagements; and, if gold is being exported, diminishes
the profit of exportation. Successive rises successively
increase these effects; until, eventually, none will give the
rate of discount asked, save those in peril of stopping
payment; the increase of the credit-currency ceases; and
the efflux of gold, if it is going on, is arrested by the
home-demand out-balancing the foreign demand. And if,
in times of great pressure, and under the temptation of
high discounts, banks allow their circulation
to expand to <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
a somewhat dangerous extent, the course is justified by the
necessities. As shown at the outset, the process is one by
which banks, on the deposit of good securities, loan their
credit to traders who but for loans would be bankrupt.
And that banks should run some risks to save hosts of
solvent men from inevitable ruin, few will deny. Moreover,
during a crisis which thus runs its natural course,
there will really occur that purification of the mercantile
world which many think can be effected only by some
Act-of-Parliament ordeal. Under the circumstances described,
men who have adequate securities to offer will
get bank-accommodation; but those who, having traded
without capital or beyond their means, have not, will be
denied it, and will fail. Under a free system the good
will be sifted from the bad; whereas the existing restrictions
on bank-accommodation, tend to destroy good and
bad together.</p>

<p>Thus it is not true that there need special regulations to
prevent the in­con­ver­ti­bil­ity and depreciation of notes. It
is not true that, but for legislative supervision, bankers
would let gold drain out of the country to an undue extent.
It is not true that these “currency theorists” have
discovered a place at which the body-politic would bleed
to death but for a State-styptic.</p>

<p class="padtopb">What else we have to say on the general question, may
best be joined with some commentaries on provincial and
joint-stock banking, to which let us now turn.</p>

<p>Government, to preserve the Bank of England-monopoly,
having enacted that no partnership exceeding six persons
should become bankers; and the Bank of England having
refused to establish branches in the provinces; it happened,
during the latter half of the last century, when the industrial
progress was rapid and banks much needed, that
numerous private traders, shopkeepers and others, began
to issue notes payable on demand. And when,
of the four <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
hundred small banks which had thus grown up in less
than fifty years, a great number gave way under the
first pressure—when, on several subsequent occasions,
like results occurred—when in Ireland, where the Bank
of Ireland-monopoly had been similarly guaranteed, it
happened that out of fifty private provincial banks, forty
became bankrupt—and when, finally, it grew notorious
that in Scotland, where there had been no law limiting the
number of partners, a whole century had passed with
scarcely a single bank-failure; legislators at once decided
to abolish the restriction which had entailed such mischiefs.
Having, to use Mr. Mill’s words, “actually made the
formation of safe banking-establishments a punishable
offence”—having, for one hundred and twenty years, maintained
a law which first caused great inconvenience and then
extensive ruin, time after time repeated—Government, in
1826, conceded the liberty of joint-stock banking: a liberty
which the good easy public, not distinguishing between a
right done and a wrong undone, regarded as a great boon!</p>

<p>But the liberty was not without conditions. Having
previously, in anxiety for its <i>protégé</i>, the Bank of England,
been reckless of the banking-security of the community at
large, the State, like a repentant sinner rushing into
asceticism, all at once became extremely solicitous on this
point; and determined to put guarantees of its own
devising, in place of the natural guarantee of mercantile
judgment. To intending bank-shareholders it said—“You
shall not unite on such publicly-understood conditions as
you think fit, and get such confidence as will naturally
come to you on those conditions.” And to the public it
said—“You shall not put trust in this or that association
in proportion as, from the character of its members and
constitution, you judge it to be worthy of trust.” But to
both it said—“You shall the one give, and the other
receive, my infallible safeguards.”</p>

<p>And now what have been the results?
Every one knows <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span>
that these safeguards have proved anything but infallible.
Every one knows that these banks with State-constitutions
have been especially characterized by instability. Every
one knows that credulous citizens, with a faith in legislation
which endless disappointments fail to diminish, have
trusted implicitly in these law-devised securities; and, not
exercising their own judgments, have been led into ruinous
undertakings. The evils of substituting artificial guarantees
for natural ones, which the clear-sighted long ago discerned,
have, by the late catastrophes, been made conspicuous to all.</p>

<p>When commencing this article we had intended to dwell
on this point. For though the mode of business which
brought about these joint-stock-bank failures was, for weeks
after their occurrence, time after time clearly described;
yet nowhere did we see drawn the obvious corollary.
Though in three separate City-articles of <i>The Times</i>, it was
explained that, “relying upon the ultimate liability of large
bodies of infatuated shareholders, the discount houses
supply these banks with unlimited means, looking not to
the character of the bills sent up, but simply to the security
afforded by the Bank endorsement;” yet, in none of them
was it pointed out that, but for the law of unlimited
liability, this reckless trading would not have gone on.
More recently, however, this truth has been duly recognized,
alike in Parliament and in the Press; and it is
therefore needless further to elucidate it. We will simply
add that as, if there had been no law of unlimited liability,
the London houses would not have discounted these bad
bills; and as, in that case, these provincial joint-stock-banks
could not have given these enormous credits to insolvent
speculators; and as, if they had not done this, they would
not have been ruined; it follows, inevitably, that these
joint-stock-bank failures have been <i>law-produced disasters</i>.</p>

<p>A measure for further increasing the safety of the provincial
public, was that which limited the circulation of
provincial bank-notes. At the same time
that it established <span class="xxpn" id="p350">{350}</span>
a sliding-scale for the issues of the Bank of England, the
Act of 1844 fixed the maximum circulation of every provincial
bank-of-issue; and forbad any further banks-of-issue.
We have not space to discuss at length the effects of this
restriction; which must have fallen rather hardly on those
especially-careful bankers who had, during the twelve
weeks preceding the 27th April, 1844, narrowed their
issues to meet any incidental contingencies; while it gave
a perennial license to such as had been incautious during
that period. All which we can notice is, that this rigorous
limitation of provincial issues to a low maximum (and a
low maximum was purposely fixed) effectually prevents
those local expansions of bank-note circulation which, as
we have shown, <i>ought</i> to take place in periods of commercial
difficulty. And further, that by transferring all
local demands to the Bank of England, as the only place
from which extra accommodation can be had, the tendency
is to concentrate a pressure which would else be diffused,
and so to create panic.</p>

<p>Saying nothing more, however, respecting the impolicy
of the measure, let us mark its futility. As a means of
preserving the convertibility of the provincial bank-note,
it is useless unless it acts as some safeguard against bank-failures;
and that it does not do this is demonstrable.
While it diminishes the likelihood of failures caused by
over-issue of notes, it increases the likelihood of failures
from other causes. For what will be done by a provincial
banker whose issues are restricted by the Act of 1844, to a
level lower than that to which he would otherwise have let
them rise? If he would, but for the law, have issued more
notes than he now does—if his reserve is greater than, in
his judgment, is needful for the security of his notes; is it
not clear that he will simply extend his operations in other
directions? Will not the excess of his available capital be
to him a warrant either for entering into larger speculations
himself, or for allowing his customers
to draw on <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span>
him beyond the limit he would else have fixed? If, in the
absence of restriction, his rashness would have led him to
risk bankruptcy by over-issue, will it not now equally lead
him to risk bankruptcy by over-banking? And is not the
one kind of bankruptcy as fatal to the convertibility of
notes as the other?</p>

<p>Nay, the case is even worse. There is reason to believe
that bankers are tempted into greater dangers under this
protective system. They can and will hypothecate their
capital in ways less direct than by notes; and may very
likely be led, by the unobtrusiveness of the process, to
commit themselves more than they would else do. A
trader, applying to his banker in times of commercial
difficulty, will often be met by the reply—“I cannot make
you any direct advances, having already loaned as much as
I can spare; but knowing you to be a safe man I will lend
you my name. Here is my acceptance for the sum you
require: they will discount it for you in London.” Now,
as loans thus made do not entail the same immediate
responsibilities as when made in notes (seeing that they are
neither at once payable, nor do they add to the dangers of
a possible run), a banker is under a temptation to extend
his liabilities in this way further than he would have done,
had not law forced him to discover a new channel through
which to give credit.</p>

<p>And does not the evidence that has lately transpired go
to show that these roundabout ways of giving credit <i>do</i>
take the place of the interdicted ways; and that they <i>are</i>
more dangerous than the interdicted ways? Is it not
notorious that dangerous forms of paper-currency have had
an unexampled development since the Act of 1844? Do
not the newspapers and the debates give daily proofs of
this? And is not the process of causation obvious?</p>

<p>Indeed it might have been known, <i>a priori</i>, that such a
result was sure to take place. It
has been shown <span class="xxpn" id="p352">{352}</span>
conclusively that, when uninterfered with, the amount of note-circulation
at any given time, is determined by the amount
of trade going on—the quantity of payments that are being
made. It has been repeatedly testified before committees,
that when any local banker contracts his issues, he simply
causes an equivalent increase in the issues of neighbouring
bankers. And in past times it has been more than once
complained, that when from prudential motives the Bank
of England withdrew part of its notes, the provincial
bankers immediately multiplied their notes to a proportionate
extent. Well, is it not manifest that this inverse
variation, which holds between one class of bank-notes and
another, also holds between bank-notes and other forms of
paper-currency? Will it not happen that just as diminishing
the note-circulation of one bank, merely adds to the
note-circulation of other banks; so, an artificial restriction
on the circulation of bank-notes in general, will simply
cause an increased circulation of some substituted kind of
promise-to-pay? And is not this substituted kind, in
virtue of its novelty and irregularity, likely to be a more
unsafe kind? See, then, the predicament. Over all the
bills of exchange, cheques, etc., which constitute nine-tenths
of the paper-currency of the kingdom, the State
exercises, and can exercise, no control. And the limit it
puts on the remaining tenth vitiates the other nine-tenths,
by causing an abnormal growth of new forms of credit,
which experience proves to be especially dangerous.</p>

<p>Thus, all which the State does when it exceeds its true
duty is to hinder, to disturb, to corrupt. As already
pointed out, the quantity of credit men will give each
other, is determined by natural causes, moral and physical—their
average characters, their temporary states of
feeling, their circumstances. If the Government forbids
one mode of giving credit, they will find another, and
probably a worse. Be the degree of
mutual trust prudent <span class="xxpn" id="p353">{353}</span>
or imprudent, it must take its course. The attempt to
restrict it by law is nothing but a repetition of the old story
of keeping out the sea with a fork.</p>

<p>And now mark that were it not for these worse than
futile State-safeguards, there might grow up certain natural
safeguards, which would really put a check on undue credit
and abnormal speculation. Were it not for the attempts to
insure security by law, it is very possible that, under our
high-pressure system of business, banks would compete with
each other in respect of the degree of security they offered—would
endeavour to outdo each other in the obtainment of
a legitimate public confidence. Consider the position of a
new joint-stock-bank with limited liability, and unchecked
by legal regulations. It can do nothing until it has gained
the general good opinion. In the way of this there stand
great difficulties. Its constitution is untried, and is sure to
be looked upon by the trading world with considerable
distrust. The field is already occupied by old banks with
established connexions and reputations. Out of a constituency
satisfied with the present accommodation, it has to
obtain supporters for a system which is apparently less
safe than the old. How shall it do this? Evidently it
must find some unusual mode of assuring the community of
its trustworthiness. And out of a number of new banks so
circumstanced, it is not too much to suppose that ultimately
one would hit on some mode. It might be, for instance,
that such a bank would give to all who held deposits over
£1000 the liberty of inspecting its books—of ascertaining
from time to time its liabilities and its investments.
Already this plan is frequently adopted by private traders,
as a means of assuring those who lend money to them; and
this extension of it might naturally take place under the
pressure of competition. We have put the question to a
gentleman who has had long and successful experience, as
manager of a joint-stock-bank, and his reply is, that some
such course would very probably be
adopted: adding that, <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span>
under this arrangement, a depositor would practically
become a partner with limited liability.</p>

<p>Were a system of this kind to establish itself, it would
form a double check to unhealthy trading. Consciousness
that its rashness would become known to its chief clients,
would prevent the bank-management from being rash; and
consciousness that his credit would be damaged when his
large debt to the bank was whispered, would prevent the
speculator from contracting so large a debt. Both lender
and borrower would be restrained from reckless enterprize.
Very little inspection would suffice to effect this end. One
or two cautious depositors would be enough; seeing that
the mere expectation of immediate disclosure, in case of
misconduct, would mostly keep in order all those concerned.</p>

<p>Should it however be contended, as by some it may, that
this safeguard would be of no avail—should it be alleged
that, having in their own hands the means of safety, citizens
would not use them, but would still put blind faith in
directors, and give unlimited trust to respectable names;
then we reply that they would deserve whatever bad consequences
fell on them. If they did not take advantage of
the proffered guarantee, the penalty be on their own heads.
We have no patience with the mawkish philanthropy which
would ward-off the punishment of stupidity. The ultimate
result of shielding men from the effects of folly, is to fill
the world with fools.</p>

<div class="section">
<p class="padtopb">A few words in conclusion respecting the attitude of our
opponents. Leaving joint-stock-bank legislation, on which
the eyes of the public are happily becoming opened; and
returning to the Bank-Charter, with its theory of currency-regulation;
we have to charge its supporters with gross, if
not wilful, misrepresentation. Their established policy is
to speak of all antagonism as identified with adhesion to
the vulgarest fallacies. They daily present, as the only
alternatives, their own dogma or some
wild doctrine too <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span>
absurd to be argued. “Side with us or choose anarchy,”
is the substance of their homilies.</p></div>

<p>To speak specifically:—They boldly assert, in the first
place, that they are the upholders of “principle;” and on
all opposition they seek to fasten the title of “empiricism.”
Now we are at a loss to see what there is “empirical” in
the position, that a bank-note-circulation will regulate
itself in the same way that the circulation of other paper-currency
does. It seems to us anything but “empirical,”
to say that the natural check of prospective bankruptcy,
which restrains the trader from issuing too many promises-to-pay
at given dates, will similarly restrain the banker
from issuing too many promises-to-pay on demand. We
take him to be the very opposite of an “empiric,” who holds
that people’s characters and circumstances determine the
quantity of credit-memoranda in circulation; and that the
monetary disorders which their imperfect characters and
changing circumstances occasionally entail, can be exacerbated,
but cannot be prevented, by State-nostrums. On
the other hand, we do not see in virtue of what “principle”
it is, that the contract expressed on the face of a bank-note
must be dealt with differently from any other contract.
We cannot understand the “principle” which requires the
State to control the business of bankers, so that they may
not make engagements they cannot fulfil, but which does
<i>not</i> require the State to do the like with other traders.
To us it is a very in­comp­re­hen­si­ble “principle” which
permits the Bank of England to issue £14,000,000 on the
credit of the State; but which is broken if the State-credit
is mortgaged beyond this—a “principle” which implies
that £14,000,000 of notes may be issued without gold
to meet them, but insists on rigorous precautions for the
convertibility of every pound more. We are curious to
learn how it was inferred from this “principle” that the
average note-circulation of each provincial bank, during
certain twelve weeks in 1844,
was exactly the <span class="xxpn" id="p356">{356}</span>
note-circulation which its capital justified. So far from discerning a
“principle,” it seems to us that both the idea and its applications
are as empirical as they can well be.</p>

<p>Still more astounding, however, is the assumption of these
“currency-theorists,” that their doctrines are those of Free-trade.
In the Legislature, Lord Overstone, and in the
press, the <i>Saturday Review</i>, have, among others, asserted
this. To call that a Free-trade measure, which has the
avowed object of restricting certain voluntary acts of exchange,
appears so manifest a contradiction in terms that it
is scarcely credible it should be made. The whole system
of currency-legislation is restrictionist from beginning to
end: equally in spirit and detail. Is that a Free-trade
regulation which has all along forbidden banks of issue
within sixty-five miles of London? Is that Free-trade
which enacts that none but such as have now the State-warrant,
shall henceforth give promises-to-pay on demand?
Is that Free-trade which at a certain point steps in between
the banker and his customer, and puts a veto on any
further exchange of credit-documents? We wonder what
would be said by two merchants, the one about to draw a
bill on the other in return for goods sold, who should be
stopped by a State-officer with the remark that, having
examined the buyer’s ledger, he was of opinion that ready
as the seller might be to take the bill, it would be unsafe
for him to do so; and that the law, in pursuance of the
principles of Free-trade, negatived the transaction! Yet
for the promise-to-pay in six months, it needs but to substitute
a promise-to-pay on demand, and the case becomes
substantially that of banker and customer.</p>

<p>It is true that the “currency-theorists” have a colourable
excuse in the fact, that among their opponents are the
advocates of various visionary schemes, and propounders of
regulations quite as protectionist in spirit as their own. It
is true that there are some who contend for inconvertible
“labour-notes;” and others who argue that,
in times of <span class="xxpn" id="p357">{357}</span>
commercial pressure, banks should not raise their rates of
discount. But is this any justification for recklessly stigmatizing
all antagonism as coming from these classes, in the
face of the fact that the Bank-Act has been protested
against by the highest authorities in political economy? Do
not the defenders of the “currency-principle” know that
among their opponents are Mr. Thornton, long known as
an able writer on currency-questions; Mr. Tooke and
Mr. Newmarch, famed for their laborious and exhaustive
researches respecting currency and prices; Mr. Fullarton,
whose “Regulation of Currencies” is a standard work;
Mr. Macleod, whose just-issued book displays the endless
injustices and stupidities of our monetary history; Mr.
James Wilson, <span class="smmaj">M.P.</span>, who, in detailed knowledge of commerce,
currency, and banking, is probably unrivalled; and
Mr. John Stuart Mill, who both as logician and economist,
stands in the first rank? Do they not know that the alleged
distinction between bank-notes and other credit-documents,
which forms the professed basis of the Bank-Act (and for
which Sir R. Peel could quote only the one poor authority
of Lord Liverpool) is denied, not only by the gentlemen
above named, but also by Mr. Huskisson, Professor Storch,
Dr. Travers Twiss, and the distinguished French Professors,
M. Joseph Garnier and M. Michel Chevalier?<a class="afnanch" href="#fn36" id="fnanch36">36</a>
Do they
not know, in short, that both the profoundest thinkers and
the most patient inquirers are against them? If they do
not know this, it is time they studied the subject on which
they write with such an air of authority. If they do know
it, a little more respect for their opponents would not
be unbecoming.</p>

<h2 class="h2nobreak">PARLIAMENTARY REFORM: THE DANGERS AND
THE SAFEGUARDS.</h2></div>

<div class="dchappre">
<p class="pfirst">[<i>First published in</i>
The Westminster Review <i>for April 1860</i>.]</p></div>

<p>Thirty years ago, the dread of impending evils agitated
not a few breasts throughout England. Instinctive fear of
change, justified as it seemed by outbursts of popular
violence, conjured up visions of the anarchy which would
follow the passing of a Reform Bill. In scattered farm-houses
there was chronic terror, lest those newly endowed
with political power should in some way filch all the profits
obtained by rearing cattle and growing corn. The
occupants of halls and manors spoke of ten-pound householders
almost as though they formed an army of spoilers,
threatening to overrun and devastate the property of
landholders. Among townspeople there were some who
interpreted the abolition of old corruptions into the
establishment of mob-government; which they thought
equivalent to spoliation. And even in Parliament, such
alarms found occasional utterance: as, for instance, through
the mouth of Sir Robert Inglis, who hinted that the national
debt would not improbably be repudiated if the proposed
measure became law.</p>

<p>There may perhaps be a few who regard the now pending
change in the representation with
similar dread—who think <span class="xxpn" id="p359">{359}</span>
that artizans and others of their grade are prepared, when
the power is given to them, to lay hands on property. We
presume, however, that such irrational alarmists form but a
small percentage of the nation. Not only throughout the
Liberal party, but among the Conservatives, there exists
a much fairer estimate of the popular character than is
implied by anticipations of so gloomy a kind. Many of the
upper and middle classes are conscious of the fact that, if
critically compared, the average conduct of the wealthy
would not be found to differ very widely in rectitude from
that of the poor. Making due allowance for differences in
the kinds and degrees of temptations to which they are
exposed, the respective grades of society are tolerably
uniform in their morals. That disregard of the rights of
property which, among the people at large, shows itself in
the direct form of petty thefts, shows itself among their
richer neighbours in various indirect forms, which are
scarcely less flagitious and often much more detrimental
to fellow-citizens. Traders, wholesale and retail, commit
countless dishonesties, ranging from adulteration and short
measure up to fraudulent bankruptcy—dishonesties of
which we sketched out some of the ramifications in a late
article on “The Morals of Trade.” The trickeries of the
turf; the bribery of electors; the non-payment of tradesmen’s
bills; the jobbing in railway-shares; the obtainment
of exorbitant prices for land from railway-companies; the
corruption that attends the getting of private bills through
Parliament—these, and other such illustrations, show that
the un­con­scien­tious­ness of the upper class, manifested
though it is in different forms, is not less than that of the
lower class: bears as great a ratio to the size of the class,
and, if traced to its ultimate results, produces evils as great
if not greater.</p>

<p>And if the facts prove that in uprightness of intentions
there is little to choose between one class of the community
and another, an extension of the
franchise cannot rationally <span class="xxpn" id="p360">{360}</span>
be opposed on the ground that property would be directly
endangered. There is no more reason to suppose that the
mass of artizans and labourers would use political power with
conscious injustice to their richer neighbours, than there is
reason to suppose that their richer neighbours now consciously
commit legal injustices against artizans and labourers.</p>

<p class="padtopb">What, then, is the danger to be apprehended? If land,
and houses, and railways, and funds, and property of all
other kinds, would be held with no less security than now,
why need there be any fears that the franchise would be
misused? What are the misuses of it which are rationally
to be anticipated?</p>

<p>The ways in which those to be endowed with political
power are likely to abuse it, may be inferred from the ways
in which political power has been abused by those who have
possessed it.</p>

<p>What general trait has characterized the rule of the
classes hitherto dominant? These classes have not habitually
sought their own <i>direct</i> advantage at the expense of other
classes; but their measures have nevertheless frequently
been such as were <i>indirectly</i> advantageous to themselves.
Voluntary self-sacrifice has been the exception. The rule
has been so to legislate as to preserve private interests
from injury; whether public interests were injured or not.
Though, in equity, a landlord has no greater claim on a
defaulting tenant than any other creditor; yet landlords,
having formed the majority of the legislature, have made
laws giving them power to recover rent in anticipation of
other creditors. Though the duties payable to government
on the transfer of property to heirs and legatees, might
justly have been made to fall more heavily on the wealthy
than on the comparatively poor, and on real property rather
than on personal property; yet the reverse arrangement
was enacted and long maintained, and is even still partially
in force. Rights of presentation to places
in the Church, <span class="xxpn" id="p361">{361}</span>
obtained however completely in violation of the spirit of the
law, are yet tenaciously defended, with little or no regard
to the welfare of those for whom the Church ostensibly
exists. Were it not accounted for by the bias of personal
interests, it would be impossible to explain the fact that, on
the question of protection to agriculture, the landed classes
and their dependents were ranged against the other classes:
the same evidence being open to both. And if there needs
a still stronger illustration, we have it in the opposition
made to the repeal of the Corn-Laws by the established
clergy. Though, by their office, preachers of justice and
mercy—though constantly occupied in condemning selfishness
and holding up a supreme example of self-sacrifice;
yet so swayed were they by those temporal interests which
they thought endangered, that they offered to this proposed
change an almost uniform resistance. Out of some ten
thousand <i>ex officio</i> friends of the poor and needy, there was
but one (the Rev. Thomas Spencer), who took an active
part in abolishing this tax imposed on the people’s bread
for the maintenance of landlords’ rents.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the ways in which, in modern times,
those who have the power seek their own benefit at the
expense of the rest. It is in analogous ways that we must
expect any section of the community which may be made
predominant by a political change, to sacrifice the welfare
of other sections to its own. While we do not see reason
to think that the lower classes are intrinsically less conscientious
than the upper classes, we do not see reason to
think that they are more conscientious. Holding, as we
do, that in each society and in each age, the morality is,
on the average, the same throughout all ranks; it seems to
us clear that if the rich, when they have the opportunity,
make laws which unduly favour themselves, the poor, if
their power was in excess, will do the like in similar ways
and to a similar extent. Without knowingly enacting
injustice, they will be unconsciously
biased by personal <span class="xxpn" id="p362">{362}</span>
considerations; and our legislation will err as much in a
new direction as it has hitherto done in the old.</p>

<p>This abstract conclusion we shall find confirmed on contemplating
the feelings and opinions current among artizans
and labourers. What the working classes now wish done,
indicates what they would be likely to do, if a reform in the
representation made them preponderate. Judging from
their prevailing sentiments, they would doubtless do, or aid
in doing, many things which it is desirable to have done.
Such a question as that of Church-rates would have been
settled long ago had the franchise been wider. Any great
increase of popular influence, would go far to rectify the
present inequitable relation of the established religious sect
to the rest of the community. And other remnants of
class-legislation would be swept away. But besides ideas
likely to eventuate in changes which we should regard as
beneficial, the working classes entertain ideas that could
not be realized without gross injustice to other classes and
ultimate injury to themselves. There is among them a
prevailing enmity towards capitalists. The fallacy that
machinery acts to their damage, is still widely spread, both
among rural labourers and the inhabitants of towns. And
they show a wish, not only to dictate how long per day
men shall work, but to regulate all the relations between
employers and employed. Let us briefly consider the
evidence of this.</p>

<p>When, adding another to the countless errors which it
has taught the people, the Legislature, by passing the Ten-Hours-Bill,
asserted that it is the duty of the State to limit
the duration of labour, there naturally arose among the
working classes the desire for further ameliorations to be
secured in the same way. First came the formidable strike
of the Amalgamated Engineers. The rules of this body
aim to restrict the supply of labour in various ways. No
member is allowed to work more than a fixed number of
hours per week; nor for less than a fixed
rate of wages. <span class="xxpn" id="p363">{363}</span>
No man is admitted into the trade who has not “earned a
right by probationary servitude.” There is a strict registration;
which is secured by fines on any one who neglects
to notify his marriage, removal, or change of service. The
council decides, without appeal, on all the affairs, individual
and general, of the body. How tyrannical are the regulations
may be judged from the fact, that members are
punished for divulging anything concerning the society’s
business; for censuring one another; for vindicating the
conduct of those fined, etc. And their own unity of action
having been secured by these coercive measures, the
Amalgamated Engineers made a prolonged effort to impose
on their employers, sundry restrictions which they supposed
would be beneficial to themselves. More recently, we have
seen similar objects worked for by similar means during
the strike of the Operative Builders. In one of their early
manifestoes, this body of men contended that they had “an
equal right to share with other workers, that large amount
of public sympathy which is now being so widely extended
in the direction of shortening the hours of labour:” thus
showing at once their delusion and its source. Believing,
as they had been taught by an Act of Parliament to believe,
that the relation between the quantity of labour given and
the wages received, is not a natural but an artificial one;
they demanded that while the wages remained the same,
the hours should be reduced from ten to nine. They
recommended their employers so to make their future
contracts, as to allow for this diminished day’s work:
saying they were “so sanguine as to consider the consummation
of their desire inevitable:” a polite way of hinting
that their employers must succumb to the irresistible power
of their organization. Referring to the threat of the master-builders
to close their works, they warned them against
“the responsibility of causing the public disaster” thus
indicated. And when the breach finally
took place, the <span class="xxpn" id="p364">{364}</span>
Unionists set in action the approved appliances for bringing
masters to terms; and would have succeeded had it not
been that their antagonists, believing that concessions
would be ruinous, made a united resistance. During
several previous years, master-builders had been yielding
to various extravagant demands, of which those recently
made were a further development. Had they assented to
the diminished day’s work, and abolished systematic overtime,
as they were required to do, there is no reason to
suppose the dictation would have ended. Success would
have presently led to still more exacting requirements; and
future years would have witnessed further extensions of
this mischievous meddling between capital and labour.</p>

<p>Perhaps the completest illustration of the industrial
regulations which find favour with artizans, is supplied by
the Printers’ Union. With the exception of those engaged
in <i>The Times</i> office, and in one other large establishment,
the proprietors of which successfully resisted the combination,
the compositors, pressmen, etc., throughout the
kingdom, form a society which controls all the relations
between employers and employed. There is a fixed price
for setting up type—so much per thousand letters: no
master can give less; no compositor being allowed by the
Union to work for less. There are established rates for
press-work; and established numbers less than which you
cannot have printed without paying for work that is not
done. The scale rises by what are called “tokens” of 250;
and if but 50 copies are required, the charge is the same as
for printing 250; or if 300 are wanted, payment must be
made for 500. Besides regulating prices and modes of
charging to their own advantage, in these and other ways,
the members of the Union restrict competition by limiting
the number of apprentices brought into the business. So
well organized is this combination that the masters are
obliged to succumb. An infraction of the
rules in any <span class="xxpn" id="p365">{365}</span>
printing-office leads to a strike of the men; and as this is
supported by the Union at large, the employer has to yield.</p>

<p>That in other trades artizans would, if they could, establish
restrictive systems equally complete with this, we take
to be sufficiently proved by their often-repeated attempts.
The Tin-plate-Workers’ strike, the Coventry-Weavers’
strikes, the Engineers’ strike, the Shoemakers’ strike, the
Builders’ strike, all show a most decided leaning towards a
despotic regulation of trade-prices, hours, and arrangements—towards
an abolition of free trade between employers
and employed. Should the men engaged in our various
industries succeed in their aims, each industry would be so
shackled as seriously to raise the cost of production. The
chief penalty would thus fall on the working classes
themselves. Each producer, while protected in the exercise
of his own occupation, would on every commodity he bought
have to pay an extra price, consequent on the protection of
other producers. In short, there would be established,
under a new form, the old mischievous system of mutual
taxation. And a final result would be such a diminished
ability to compete with other nations as to destroy our
foreign trade.</p>

<p>Against results like these it behoves us to guard. It
becomes a grave question how far we may safely give
political power to those who entertain views so erroneous
respecting fundamental social relations; and who so pertinaciously
struggle to enforce these erroneous views. Men
who render up their private liberties to the despotic rulers
of trades-unions, seem scarcely independent enough rightly
to exercise political liberties. Those who so ill understand
the nature of freedom, as to think that any man or body of
men has a right to prevent employer and employed from
making any contract they please, would almost appear to be
incapacitated for the guardianship of their own freedom and
that of their fellow-citizens. When their notions of rectitude
are so confused, that they think it a duty to
obey the arbitrary <span class="xxpn" id="p366">{366}</span>
commands of their union-authorities, and to abandon the
right of individually disposing of their labour on their own
terms—when, in conformity with this inverted sense of duty,
they even risk the starvation of their families—when they
call that an “odious document” which simply demands that
master and man shall be free to make their own bargains—when
their sense of justice is so obtuse that they are ready
to bully, to deprive of work, to starve, and even to kill,
members of their own class who rebel against dictation, and
assert their rights to sell their labour at such rates and to
such persons as they think fit—when in short they prove
themselves ready to become alike slaves and tyrants, we may
well pause before giving them the franchise.</p>

<p>The objects which artizans have long sought to achieve by
their private organizations, they would, had they adequate
political power, seek to achieve by public enactments. If,
on points like those instanced, their convictions are so strong
and their determination so great, that they will time after
time submit to extreme privations in the effort to carry
them; it is a reasonable expectation that these convictions,
pushed with this determination, would soon be expressed in
law, if those who held them had predominant power. With
working men, questions concerning the regulation of labour
are of the highest interest. Candidates for Parliament
would be more likely to obtain their suffrages by pandering
to their prejudices on such questions, than in any other way.
Should it be said that no evil need be feared unless the
artizan-class numerically preponderated in the con­stit­uen­cies;
it may be rejoined that not unfrequently, where two
chief political parties are nearly balanced, some other party,
though much smaller, determines the election. When we
bear in mind that the trades-unions throughout the kingdom
number 600,000 members, and command a fund of £300,000—when
we remember that these trades-unions are in the
habit of aiding each other, and have even been incorporated
into one national association—when we
also remember that <span class="xxpn" id="p367">{367}</span>
their organization is very complete, and their power over
their members mercilessly exercised; it seems likely that at
a general election their combined action would decide the
result in many towns: even though the artizans in each case
formed but a moderate portion of the constituency. How
influential small but combined bodies are, the Irish Members
of our House of Commons prove to us; and still more
clearly the Irish emigrants in America. Certainly these
trade-combinations are not less perfectly organized; nor
are the motives of their members less strong. Judge then
how efficient their political action would be.</p>

<p>It is true that in county-con­stit­uen­cies and rural towns,
the artizan class have no power; and that in the antagonism
of agriculturists there would be a restraint on their projects.
But, on the other hand, the artizans would, on these questions,
have the sympathy of many not belonging to their own body.
Numerous small shopkeepers and others who are in point of
means about on their level, would go with them in their
efforts to regulate the relations of capital and labour.
Among the middle classes, too, there are not a few kindly-disposed
men who are so ignorant of political economy as to
think the artizans justified in their aims. Even among the
landed class they might find supporters. We have but to
recollect the antipathy shown by landowners in Parliament
to the manufacturing interest, during the ten-hours’ agitation,
to see that it is quite possible for country squires to
join the working men in imposing restrictions unfavourable
to employers. True, the angry feeling which then prompted
them has in some measure died away. It is to be hoped,
too, that they have gained wisdom. But still, remembering
the past, we must take this contingency into account.</p>

<p>Here, then, is one of the dangers to which an extension
of the franchise opens the door. While the fear that the
rights of property may be directly interfered with, is
absurd, it is a very rational fear that the rights of property
may be indirectly interfered with—that,
by cramping laws, <span class="xxpn" id="p368">{368}</span>
the capitalist may be prevented from using his money as
he finds best, and the workman from selling his labour as
he pleases. We are not prepared to say what widening of
the representation would bring about such results. We
profess neither to estimate what amount of artizan-power a
£6 or a £5 borough-franchise would give; nor to determine
whether the opposing powers would suffice to keep it in
check. Our purpose here is simply to indicate this establishment
of injurious industrial regulations, as one of the
dangers to be kept in view.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Turn we now to another danger, distinct from the foregoing
though near akin to it. Next after the evils of that
over-legislation which restricts the exchange of capital and
labour, come the evils of that over-legislation which provides
for the community, by State-agency, benefits which
capital and labour should be left spontaneously to provide.
And it naturally, though unfortunately, happens, that those
who lean to the one kind of over-legislation, lean also to
the other kind. Men leading laborious lives, relieved by
little in the shape of enjoyment, give willing ears to the
doctrine that the State should provide them with various
positive advantages and gratifications. The much-enduring
poor cannot be expected to deal very critically with those
who promise them gratis pleasures. As a drowning man
catches at a straw, so will one whose existence is burdensome
catch at anything, no matter how unsubstantial,
which holds out the slightest hope of a little happiness.
We must not, therefore, blame the working-classes for
being ready converts to socialistic schemes, or to a belief
in “the sovereign power of political machinery.”</p>

<p>Not that the working-classes alone fall into these delusions.
Unfortunately they are countenanced, and have
been in part misled, by those above them. In Parliament
and out of Parliament, well-meaning men among the upper
and middle ranks, have been active apostles
of these false <span class="xxpn" id="p369">{369}</span>
doctrines. There has ever been, and continues to be, much
law-making based on the assumption, that it is the duty of
the State, not simply to insure each citizen fair play in the
battle of life, but to help him in fighting the battle of life:
having previously taken money from his, or some one else’s,
pocket to pay the cost of doing this. And we cannot
glance over the papers without seeing how active are the
agitations carried on out of doors in furtherance of this
policy; and how they threaten to become daily more active.
The doings of the Chadwick-school furnish one set of
illustrations. From those of the Shaftesbury-school other
illustrations may be gathered. And in the transactions of
the body, absurdly self-entitled “The National Association
for the Promotion of Social Science,” we find still more
numerous developments of this mischievous error.</p>

<p>When we say that the working-classes, and more
especially the artizan-classes, have strong leanings towards
these Utopianisms which they have unhappily been encouraged
to entertain by many who should have known
better, we do not speak at random. We are not drawing
an <i>a priori</i> inference as to the doctrines likely to find
favour with men in their position. Nor are we guided
merely by evidence to be gathered from newspapers. We
have a basis of definite fact in the proceedings of reformed
municipal governments. These bodies have from year to
year extended their functions; and so heavy has in some
cases become the consequent local taxation, as to have
caused a reaction against the political party which was
responsible. Town-councils almost exclusively Whig, have
of late been made comparatively Conservative, by the
efforts of those richer classes who suffer most from municipal
extravagance. With whom, then, has this extravagance
been popular? With the poorer members of the con­stit­uen­cies.
Candidates for town-councillorships have found no
better means of obtaining the suffrages of the mass, than
the advocacy of this or the other
local undertaking. To <span class="xxpn" id="p370">{370}</span>
build baths and wash-houses at the expense of the town,
has proved a popular proposal. The support of public
gardens out of funds raised by local rates, has been applauded
by the majority. So, too, with the establishment
of free libraries, which has, of course, met with encouragement
from working-men, and from those who wish to find
favour with them. Should some one, taking a hint from
the cheap concerts now common in our manufacturing
towns, propose to supply music at the public cost, we doubt
not he would be hailed as a friend of the people. And
similarly with countless socialistic schemes, of which, when
once commenced, there is no end.</p>

<p>Such being the demonstrated tendencies of municipal
governments, with their extended bases of representation,
is it not a fair inference that a Central Government having a
base of representation much wider than the present, would
manifest like tendencies? We shall see the more reason
for fearing this, when we remember that those who approve
of multiplied State-agencies, would generally ally themselves
with those who seek for the legislative regulation of labour.
The doctrines are near akin; and they are, to a considerable
extent, held by the same persons. If united the two bodies
would have a formidable power; and, appealed to, as they
would often be, by candidates expressing agreement on
both these points, they might, even though a minority, get
unduly represented in the legislature. Such, at least,
seems to us a further danger. Led by philanthropists
having sympathies stronger than their intellects, the
working-classes are very likely to employ their influence
in increasing over-legislation: not only by agitating for
industrial regulations, but in various other ways. What
extension of franchise would make this danger a serious
one, we do not pretend to say. Here, as before, we would
simply indicate a probable source of mischief.</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now what are the safeguards? Not
such as we <span class="xxpn" id="p371">{371}</span>
believe will be adopted. To meet evils like those which
threaten to follow the impending political change, the
common plan is to devise special checks—minor limitations
and qualifications. Not to dry up the evil at its source but
to dam it out, is, in analogous cases, the usual aim. We
have no faith in such methods. The only efficient safeguard
lies in a change of convictions and motives. And,
to work a change of this kind, there is no certain way but
that of letting men directly feel the penalties which mistaken
legislation brings on them. “How is this to be
done?” the reader will doubtless ask. Simply by letting
causes and effects stand in their natural relations. Simply
by taking away those vicious arrangements which now
mostly prevent men from seeing the reactions that follow
legislative actions.</p>

<p>At present the extension of public ad­min­i­stra­tions is
popular, mainly because there has not been established
in the minds of the people, any distinct connexion between
the benefits to be gained and the expenses to be paid.
Of the conveniences or gratifications secured to them by
some new body of officials with a fund at its disposal,
they have immediate experience; but of the way in which
the costs fall on the nation, and ultimately on themselves,
they have no immediate experience. Our fiscal arrangements
dissociate the ideas of increased public expenditure
and increased burdens on all who labour; and thus
encourage the superstition that law can give gratis benefits.
This is clearly the chief cause of that municipal extravagance
to which we have above adverted. The working
men of our towns possess public power, while most of
them do not directly bear public burdens. On small
houses the taxes for borough-purposes are usually paid
by the landlords; and of late years, for the sake of
convenience and economy, there has grown up a system
of compounding with landlords of small houses even for
the poor-rates chargeable to their
tenants. Under this <span class="xxpn" id="p372">{372}</span>
arrangement, at first voluntary but now compulsory, a
certain discount off the total rates due from a number
of houses is allowed to the owner, in consideration of his
paying the rates, and thus saving the authorities trouble
and loss in collection. And he is supposed to raise his
rents by the full amount of the rates charged. Thus,
most municipal electors, not paying local taxes in a separate
form, are not constantly reminded of the connexion
between public expenditure and personal costs; and hence
it happens that any outlay made for local purposes, no
matter how extravagant and unreasonable, which brings
to them some kind of advantage, is regarded as pure gain.
If the corporation resolves, quite unnecessarily, to rebuild
a town-hall, the resolution is of course approved by the
majority. “It is good for trade and it costs us nothing,”
is the argument which passes vaguely through their minds.
If some one proposes to buy an adjoining estate and turn
it into a public park, the working classes naturally give
their support to the proposal; for ornamental grounds
cannot but be an advantage, and though the rates may be
increased that will be no affair of theirs. Thus necessarily
arises a tendency to multiply public agencies and increase
public outlay. It becomes an established policy with
popularity-hunters to advocate new works to be executed
by the town. Those who disapprove this course are in
fear that their seats may be jeopardized at the next
election, should they make a vigorous opposition. And
thus do these local ad­min­i­stra­tions inevitably lean towards
abnormal developments.</p>

<p>No one can, we think, doubt that were the rates levied
directly on all electors, a check would be given to this
municipal communism. If each small occupier found that
every new work undertaken by the authorities cost him
so many pence extra in the pound, he would begin to
consider with himself whether the advantage gained was
equivalent to the price paid; and would
often reach a <span class="xxpn" id="p373">{373}</span>
negative conclusion. It would become a question with
him whether, instead of letting the local government
provide him with certain remote advantages in return for
certain moneys, he might not himself purchase with such
moneys immediate advantages of greater worth; and,
generally, he would decide that he could do this. Without
saying to what extent such a restraint would act, we may
safely say that it would be beneficial. Every one must
admit that each inhabitant of a town ought constantly to
be reminded of the relation between the work performed
for him by the corporation and the sum he pays for it.
No one can deny that the habitual experience of this
relation would tend to keep the action of local governments
within proper bounds.</p>

<p>Similarly with the Central Government. Here the effects
wrought by public agencies are still more dissociated from
the costs they entail on each citizen. The bulk of the
taxes being raised in so unobtrusive a way, and affecting
the masses in modes so difficult to trace, it is scarcely
possible for the masses to realize the fact that the sums
paid by Government for supporting schools, for facilitating
emigration, for inspecting mines, factories, railways, ships,
etc., have been in great part taken from their own pockets.
The more intelligent of them understand this as an abstract
truth; but it is not a truth present to their minds in such
a definite shape as to influence their actions. Quite
otherwise, however, would it be if taxation were direct;
and the expense of every new State-agency were felt by
each citizen as an additional demand made on him by the
tax-gatherer. Then would there be a clear, constantly-recurring
experience of the truth, that for everything
which the State gives with one hand it takes away
something with the other; and then would it be less easy
to propagate absurd delusions about the powers and duties
of Governments. No one can question this conclusion who
calls to mind the reason currently
given for maintaining <span class="xxpn" id="p374">{374}</span>
indirect taxation; namely, that the required revenue could
not otherwise be raised. Statesmen see that if instead of
taking from the citizen here a little and there a little,
in ways that he does not know or constantly forgets, the
whole amount were demanded in a lump sum, it would
scarcely be possible to get it paid. Grumbling and
resistance would rise probably to disaffection. Coercion
would in hosts of cases be needed to obtain this large
total tax; which, indeed, even with this aid, could not
be obtained from the majority of the people, whose
improvident habits prevent the accumulation of considerable
sums. And so the revenue would fall immensely short
of that expenditure which is supposed necessary. This
being assented to, it must perforce be admitted that under
a system of direct taxation, further extension of public
ad­min­i­stra­tions, entailing further costs, would meet with
general opposition. Instead of multiplying the functions
of the State, the tendency would obviously be to reduce
their number.</p>

<p>Here, then, is one of the safeguards. The incidence
of taxation must be made more direct in proportion as
the franchise is extended. Our changes ought not to be
in the direction of the Com­pound-House­hold­ers-Act of
1851, which makes it no longer needful for a Parliamentary
elector to have paid poor-rates before giving a vote; but
they ought to be in the opposite direction. The exercise
of power over the national revenue, should be indissolubly
associated with the <i>conscious</i> payment of contributions to
that revenue. Direct taxation instead of being limited, as
many wish, must be extended to lower and wider classes,
as fast as these classes are endowed with political power.</p>

<p>Probably this proposal will be regarded with small favour
by statesmen. It is not in the nature of things for men
to approve a system which tends to restrict their powers.
We know, too, that any great extension of direct taxation
will be held at present impossible; and we
are not prepared <span class="xxpn" id="p375">{375}</span>
to assert the contrary. This, however, is no reason against
reducing the indirect taxation and augmenting the direct
taxation as far as circumstances allow. And if when the
last had been increased and the first decreased to the
greatest extent now practicable, it were made an established
principle that any additional revenue must be raised by
direct taxes, there would be an efficient check to one of the
evils likely to follow from further political enfranchisement.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The other evil which we have pointed out as rationally
to be feared, cannot be thus met, however. Though an
ever-recurring experience of the relation between State-action
and its cost, would hinder the growth of those
State-agencies which undertake to supply citizens with
positive conveniences and gratifications; it would be no
restraint on that negative and inexpensive over-legislation
which trespasses on individual freedom—it would not prevent
mischievous meddling with the relations between labour
and capital. Against this danger the only safeguards
appear to be, the spread of sounder views among the
working classes, and the moral advance which such sounder
views imply.</p>

<p>“That is to say, the people must be educated,” responds
the reader. Yes, education is the thing wanted; but not
the education for which most men agitate. Ordinary
school-training is not a preparation for the right exercise
of political power. Conclusive proof of this is given by the
fact that the artizans, from whose mistaken ideas the most
danger is to be feared, are the best informed of the working
classes. Far from promising to be a safeguard, the spread
of such education as is commonly given appears more likely
to increase the danger. Raising the working classes in
general to the artizan-level of culture, threatens to augment,
rather than to diminish, their power of working political
evil. The current faith in Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic,
as fitting men for citizenship, seems
to us quite <span class="xxpn" id="p376">{376}</span>
unwarranted; as are, indeed, most other anticipations of
the benefits to be derived from learning lessons. There is
no connexion between the ability to parse a sentence, and
a clear understanding of the causes which determine the
rate of wages. The multiplication-table affords no aid in
seeing through the fallacy that the destruction of property
is good for trade. Long practice may have produced
extremely good penmanship without having given the least
power to understand the paradox that machinery eventually
increases the number of persons employed in the trades
into which it is introduced. Nor is it proved that smatterings
of mensuration, astronomy, or geography, fit men for
estimating the characters and motives of Parliamentary
candidates. Indeed we have only thus to bring together
the antecedents and the anticipated consequents, to see
how untenable is the belief in a relation between them.
When we wish a girl to become a good musician, we seat
her before the piano: we do not put drawing implements
into her hands, and expect music to come along with skill in
the use of pencils and colour-brushes. Sending a boy to pore
over law-books would be thought an extremely irrational way
of preparing him for civil engineering. And if in these and
all other cases, we do not expect fitness for any function
except through instruction and exercise in that function;
why do we expect fitness for citizenship to be produced by
a discipline which has no relation to the duties of the citizen?
Probably it will be replied that by making the working
man a good reader, we give him access to sources of information
from which he may learn how to use his electoral
power; and that other studies sharpen his faculties and
make him a better judge of political questions. This is
true; and the eventual tendency is unquestionably good.
But what if for a long time to come he reads only to obtain
confirmation of his errors? What if there exists a literature
appealing to his prejudices, and supplying him with fallacious
arguments for the mistaken beliefs which
he naturally takes <span class="xxpn" id="p377">{377}</span>
up? What if he rejects all teaching that aims to disabuse
him of cherished delusions? Must we not say that the
culture which thus merely helps the workman to establish
himself in error, rather unfits than fits him for citizenship?
And do not the trades’-unions furnish evidence of this?</p>

<p>How little that which people commonly call education
prepares them for the use of political power, may be judged
from the incompetency of those who have received the
highest education the country affords. Glance back at the
blunders of our legislation, and then remember that the
men who committed them had mostly taken University-degrees;
and you must admit that the profoundest ignorance
of Social Science may accompany intimate acquaintance
with all which our cultivated classes regard as valuable
knowledge. Do but take a young member of Parliament,
fresh from Oxford or Cambridge, and ask him what he
thinks Law should do, and why? or what it should not do,
and why? and it will become manifest that neither his
familiarity with Aristotle nor his readings in Thucydides,
have prepared him to answer the very first question a
legislator ought to solve. A single illustration will suffice
to show how different an education from that usually given,
is required by legislators, and consequently by those who
elect them: we mean the illustration which the Free-trade
agitation supplies. By kings, peers, and members of
Parliament, mostly brought up at universities, trade had
been hampered by protections, prohibitions, and bounties.
For centuries had been maintained these legislative
appliances which a very moderate insight shows to be
detrimental. Yet, of all the highly-educated throughout
the nation during these centuries, scarcely a man saw how
mischievous such appliances were. Not from one who
devoted himself to the most approved studies, came the
work which set politicians right on these points; but from
one who left college without a degree, and prosecuted
inquiries which the established
education ignored. Adam <span class="xxpn" id="p378">{378}</span>
Smith examined for himself the industrial phenomena of
societies; contemplated the productive and distributive
activities going on around him; traced out their complicated
mutual dependences; and thus reached general
principles for political guidance. In recent days, those
who have most clearly understood the truths he enunciated,
and by persevering exposition have converted the nation
to their views, have not been graduates of universities.
While, contrariwise, those who have passed through the prescribed
<i>curriculum</i>, have commonly been the most bitter and
obstinate opponents of the changes dictated by politico-economical
science. In this all-important direction, right
legislation was urged by men deficient in the so-called
best education, and was resisted by the great majority
of men who had received this so-called best education!</p>

<p>The truth for which we contend, and which is so
strangely overlooked, is, indeed, almost a truism. Does
not our whole theory of training imply that the right
preparation for political power is political cultivation?
Must not that teaching which can alone guide the citizen
in the fulfilment of his public actions, be a teaching that
acquaints him with the effects of his public actions?</p>

<p>The second chief safeguard to which we must trust is,
then, the spread, not of that mere technical and miscellaneous
knowledge which men are so eagerly propagating,
but of political knowledge; or, to speak more accurately—knowledge
of Social Science. Above all, the essential
thing is the establishment of a true theory of government—a
true conception of what legislation is for, and what are
its proper limits. This question which our political discussions
habitually ignore, is a question of greater moment
than any other. Inquiries which statesmen deride as
speculative and unpractical, will one day be found infinitely
more practical than those which they wade through Blue
Books to master, and nightly spend many hours in debating.
The considerations that every morning fill
a dozen columns <span class="xxpn" id="p379">{379}</span>
of <i>The Times</i>, are mere frivolities when compared with the
fundamental consideration—What is the proper sphere of
government? Before discussing the way in which law
should regulate some particular thing, would it not be wise
to put the previous question—Whether law ought or ought
not to meddle with that thing? and before answering this,
to put the more general questions—What law should do?
and what it should leave undone? Surely, if there are any
limits at all to legislation, the settlement of these limits
must have effects far more profound than any particular
Act of Parliament can have; and must be by so much the
more momentous. Surely, if there is danger that the
people may misuse political power, it is of supreme importance
that they should be taught for what purpose political
power ought alone to be used.</p>

<p>Did the upper classes understand their position they
would, we think, see that the diffusion of sound views on
this matter more nearly concerns their own welfare and
that of the nation at large, than any other thing whatever.
Popular influence will inevitably go on increasing. Should
the masses gain a predominant power while their ideas of
social arrangements and legislative action remain as crude
as at present, there will certainly result disastrous meddlings
with the relations of capital and labour, as well as a disastrous
extension of State-ad­min­i­stra­tions. Immense damage
will be inflicted: primarily on employers; secondarily on
the employed; and eventually on the nation as a whole.
If these evils can be prevented at all, they can be prevented
only by establishing in the public mind a profound conviction
that there are certain definite limits to the functions of
the State; and that these limits ought on no account to be
transgressed. Having learned what these limits are, the
upper classes ought to use all means of making them
clear to the people.</p>

<p class="padtopb">In No. XXIV. of this Review, for
October, 1857, we <span class="xxpn" id="p380">{380}</span>
endeavoured to show that while rep­re­sen­ta­tive government
is, by its intrinsic nature, better than any other for administering
justice or insuring equitable relations among citizens,
it is, by its intrinsic nature, worse than any other for all the
various additional functions which governments commonly
undertake. To the question—What is rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government good for? our reply was—“It is good,
especially good, good above all others, for doing the thing
which a government should do. It is bad, especially bad,
bad above all others, for doing the things which a government
should not do.”</p>

<p>To this truth we may here add a correlative one. As
fast as a government, by becoming rep­re­sen­ta­tive, grows
better fitted for maintaining the rights of citizens, it grows
not only unfitted for other purposes, but dangerous for
other purposes. In gaining adaptation for the essential
function of a government, it loses such adaptation as it had
for other functions; not only because its complexity is a
hindrance to administrative action, but also because in
discharging other functions it must be mischievously
influenced by class bias. So long as it is confined to the
duty of preventing the aggressions of individuals on one
another, and protecting the nation at large against external
enemies, the wider its basis the better; for all men are
similarly interested in the security of life, property, and
freedom to exercise the faculties. But let it undertake
to bring home positive benefits to citizens, or to interfere
with any of the special relations between class and
class, and there necessarily enters an incentive to injustice.
For in no such cases can the immediate interests of all
classes be alike. Therefore do we say that as fast as
representation is extended, the sphere of government must
be contracted.</p>

<p class="padtopb"><span class="smcap">P<b>OSTSCRIPT</b>.</span>—Since the foregoing pages were written,
Lord John Russell has introduced his Reform
Bill; and in <span class="xxpn" id="p381">{381}</span>
application of the general principles we contend for, a few
words may fitly be added respecting it.</p>

<p>Of the extended county-franchise most will approve,
save those whose illegitimate influence is diminished by it.
Adding to the rural con­stit­uen­cies a class less directly
dependent on large landowners, can scarcely fail to be
beneficial. Even should it not at first perceptibly affect
the choice of rep­re­sen­ta­tives, it will still be a good stimulus
to political education and to consequent future benefits.
Of the re-distribution of seats little is to be said, further
than that, however far short it may fall of an equitable
arrangement, it is perhaps as much as can at present
be obtained.</p>

<p>Whether the right limit for the borough-franchise has
been chosen is, on the other hand, a question that admits
of much discussion. Some hesitation will probably be felt
by all who duly weigh the evidence on both sides. Believing,
as we do, that the guidance of abstract equity, however
much it may need qualification, must never be ignored, we
should be glad were it at once practicable more nearly to
follow it; since it is certain that only as fast as the injustice
of political exclusion is brought to an end, will the many
political injustices which grow out of it disappear. Nevertheless,
we are convinced that the forms which freedom
requires will not of themselves produce the reality of
freedom, in the absence of an appropriate national character;
any more than the most perfect mechanism will do its
work in the absence of a motive power. There seems
reason to think that the degree of liberty a people is
capable of in any given age, is a fixed quantity; and that
any artificial extension of it in one direction brings about
an equivalent limitation in some other direction. French
republics show scarcely any more respect for individual
rights than the despotisms they supplant; and French
electors use their freedom to put themselves again in
slavery. In America the feeble restraints
imposed by the <span class="xxpn" id="p382">{382}</span>
State are supplemented by the strong restraints of a public
opinion which, in many respects, holds the citizens in
greater bondage than here. And if there needs a demonstration
that rep­re­sen­ta­tive equality is an insufficient safeguard
for freedom, we have it in the trades’-unions already
referred to; which, purely democratic as are their organizations,
yet exercise over their members a tyranny almost
Neapolitan in its rigour and unscrupulousness. The
greatest attainable amount of individual liberty being the
true end; and the diffusion of political power being
regarded mainly as a means to this end; the real question
when considering further extensions of the franchise, is—whether
the average freedom of action of citizens will be
increased?—whether men will be severally freer than
before to pursue the objects of life in their own way? Or,
in the present case, the question is—whether the good
which £7, £6, or £5 householders would do in helping to
abolish existing injustices, will be partly or wholly
neutralized by the evil they may do in establishing other
injustices? The desideratum is as large an increase in the
electorate as can be made without enabling the people to
carry out their delusive schemes of over-legislation.
Whether the increase proposed is greater or less than this,
is the essential point. Let us briefly consider the evidence
on each side.</p>

<p>As shown by Lord J. Russell’s figures, the new borough-electors
will consist mainly of artizans; and these, as we
have seen, are in great part banded together by a common
wish to regulate the relations of capital and labour. As a
class, they are not as Lord J. Russell describes them,
“fitted to exercise the franchise freely and independently.”
On the contrary, there are no men in the community so
shackled. They are the slaves of the authorities they have
themselves set up. The dependence of farmers on landlords,
or of operatives on employers, is much less servile;
for they can carry their capital or
labour elsewhere. But <span class="xxpn" id="p383">{383}</span>
the penalty for disobedience to trades-union dictates,
pursues the rebel throughout the kingdom. Hence the
great mass of the new borough-electors must be expected
to act simultaneously, on the word of command being
issued from a central council of united trades. Even while
we write we meet with fresh reason for anticipating this
result. An address from the Conference of the Building
Trades to the working classes throughout the kingdom,
has just been published; thanking them for their support;
advising the maintenance of the organization; anticipating
future success in their aims; and intimating the propriety
of recommencing the nine-hours’ agitation. We must,
then, be prepared to see these industrial questions made
leading questions; for artizans have a much keener interest
in them than in any others. And we may feel certain that
many elections will turn upon them.</p>

<p>How many? There are some thirty boroughs in which
the newly-enfranchised will form an actual majority—will,
if they act together, be able to outvote the existing electors;
even supposing the parties into which they are now
divided were to unite. In half-a-dozen other boroughs the
newly-enfranchised will form a virtual majority—will preponderate
unless the present liberal and conservative voters
co-operate with great unanimity, which they will be unlikely
to do. And the number proposed to be added to the constituency,
is one-half or more in nearly fifty other boroughs:
that is, in nearly fifty other boroughs, the new party will
be able to arbitrate between the two existing parties; and
will give its support to whichever of these promises most
aid to artizan-schemes. It maybe said that in this estimate
we assume the whole of the new borough-electors to belong
to the artizan-class, which they do not. This is true. But,
on the other hand, it must be remembered that among the
£10 householders there is a very considerable sprinkling of
this class, while the freemen chiefly consist of it; and hence
the whole artizan body in each
constituency will probably <span class="xxpn" id="p384">{384}</span>
be not smaller than we have assumed. If so, it follows
that should the trades-union organization be brought to
bear on borough-elections, as it is pretty certain to be, it
may prevail in some eighty or ninety places, and sway the
votes of rep­re­sen­ta­tives in from 100 to 150 seats—supposing,
that is, that it can obtain as many eligible candidates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the county-con­stit­uen­cies in their proposed
state, as much as in their existing state, not being under
trades-union influence, may be expected to stand in antagonism
to the artizan-con­stit­uen­cies; as may also the small
boroughs. It is just possible, indeed, that irritated by the
ever-growing power of a rich mercantile class, continually
treading closer on their heels, the landowners, carrying
with them their dependents, might join the employed in
their dictation to employers; just as, in past times, the
nobles joined the commonalty against the kings, or the
kings joined the commonalty against the nobles. But
leaving out this remote contingency, we may fairly expect
the rural con­stit­uen­cies to oppose the large urban ones
on these industrial questions. Thus, then, the point to be
decided is, whether the benefits that will result from this
extended suffrage—benefits which we doubt not will be
great—may not be secured while the ac­com­pa­ny­ing evil
tendencies are kept in check. It may be that these new
artizan-electors will be powerful for good, while their
power to work evil will be in a great degree neutralized.
But this we should like to see well discussed.</p>

<p>On one question, however, we feel no hesitation; namely,
the question of a rate­pay­ing-qual­i­fi­ca­tion. From Lord
John Russell’s answer to Mr. Bright, and more recently
from his answer to Mr. Steel, we gather that on this
point there is to be no alteration—that £6 householders
will stand on the same footing that £10 householders do
at present. Now by the Com­pound-House­hold­ers-Act of
1851, to which we have already referred, it is provided
that tenants of £10 houses whose rates are
paid by their <span class="xxpn" id="p385">{385}</span>
landlords, shall, after having <i>once</i> tendered payment of
rates to the authorities, be thereafter considered as ratepayers,
and have votes accordingly. That is to say, the
rate­pay­ing-qual­i­fi­ca­tion is made nominal; and that in
practice it has become so, is proved by the fact that
under this Act, 4000 electors were suddenly added to the
constituency of Manchester.</p>

<p>The continuance and extension of this arrangement we
conceive to be wholly vicious. Already we have shown
that the incidence of taxation ought to be made more
direct as fast as popular power is increased, and that, as
diminishing the elector’s personal experience of the costs
of public ad­min­i­stra­tion, this abolition of a rate­pay­ing-qual­i­fi­ca­tion
is a retrograde step. But this is by no means
the sole ground for disapproval. The rate­pay­ing-qual­i­fi­ca­tion
is a valuable test—a test which tends to separate
the more worthy of the working classes from the less
worthy. Nay more, it tends to select for enfranchisement,
those who have the moral and intellectual qualities especially
required for judicious political conduct. For what
general mental characteristic does judicious political conduct
presuppose? The power of realizing remote consequences.
People who are misled by demagogues, are those who are
impressed with the proximate results set forth to them but
are not impressed by the distant results, even when these
are explained—regard them as vague, shadowy, theoretical,
and are not to be deterred by them from clutching at a
promised boon. Conversely, the wise citizen is the one
who conceives the distant evils so clearly that they are
practically present to him, and thus outweigh the immediate
temptation. Now these are just the respective char­ac­ter­is­tics
of the two classes of tenants whom a rate­pay­ing-qual­i­fi­ca­tion
separates:—the one having their rates paid
by their landlords and so losing their votes; the other
paying their own rates that they may get votes:—the one
unable to resist present temptations, unable
to save money, <span class="xxpn" id="p386">{386}</span>
and therefore so inconvenienced by the payment of rates
as to be disfranchised rather than pay them; the other
resisting present temptations and saving money, with the
view, among other ends, of paying rates and becoming
electors. Trace these respective traits to their sources,
and it becomes manifest that, on the average, the pecuniarily
improvident must be also the politically improvident;
and that the politically provident must be far more
numerous among those who are pecuniarily provident.
Hence, it is folly to throw aside a regulation under which
these spontaneously separate themselves—severally disfranchise
themselves
and enfranchise themselves.</p>

<p>A test of senatorial capacity is a desideratum. We
rarely learn how near the mark or how wide of the mark
the calculations of statesmen are: the slowness and complexity
of social changes, hindering, as they do, the definite
comparisons of results with anticipations. Occasionally,
however, parliamentary decisions admit of being definitely
valued. One which was arrived at a few weeks ago furnished
a measure of legislative judgment too significant to
be passed by.</p>

<p>On the edge of the Cotswolds, just above the valley of
the Severn, occur certain springs, which, as they happen
to be at the end of the longest of the hundred streams
which join to form the Thames, have been called by a
poetical fiction “the sources of the Thames.” Names, even
when poetical fictions, suggest conclusions; and conclusions
drawn from words instead of facts are equally apt to influence
conduct. Thus it happened that when, recently, there was
formed a company for supplying Cheltenham and some
other places from these springs, great opposition arose.
The <i>Times</i> published a paragraph headed “Threatened
Absorption of the Thames,” stating that
the application of <span class="xxpn" id="p388">{388}</span>
this company to Parliament had “caused some little consternation
in the city of Oxford, and will, doubtless,
throughout the valley of the Thames;” and that “such a
measure, if carried out, will diminish the water of that
noble river a million of gallons per day.” A million is
an alarming word—suggests something necessarily vast.
Translating words into thoughts, however, would have
calmed the fears of the <i>Times</i> paragraphist. Considering
that a million gallons would be contained by a room fifty-six
feet cube, the nobility of the Thames would not be
much endangered by the deduction. The simple fact is,
that the current of the Thames, above the point at which
the tides influence it, discharges in twenty-four hours eight
hundred times this amount!</p>

<p>When the bill of this proposed water-company was brought
before the House of Commons for second reading, it became
manifest that the imaginations of our rulers were affected
by such expressions as the “sources of the Thames,” and
“a million gallons daily,” in much the same way as the
imaginations of the ignorant. Though the quantity of
water proposed to be taken bears, to the quantity which
runs over Teddington weir, about the same ratio that a yard
bears to half a mile, it was thought by many members that
its loss would be a serious evil. No method of measurement
would be accurate enough to detect the difference between
the Thames as it now is, and the Thames <i>minus</i> the Cerney
springs; and yet it was gravely stated in the House that,
were the Thames diminished in the proposed way, “the
proportion of sewage to pure water would be seriously increased.”
Taking a minute out of twelve hours, would be
taking as large a proportion as the Cheltenham people wish
to take from the Thames. Nevertheless, it was contended
that to let Cheltenham have this quantity would be “to rob
the towns along the banks of the Thames of their rights,”
Though, of the Thames flowing by each of these towns,
some 999 parts out of 1,000 pass by unused,
it was held <span class="xxpn" id="p389">{389}</span>
that a great injustice would be committed were one or two
of these 999 parts appropriated by the inhabitants of a
town who can now obtain daily but four gallons of foul
water per head!</p>

<p>But the apparent inability thus shown to think of causes
and effects in something like their true quantitative relations,
was still more conspicuously shown. It was stated by
several members that the Thames Navigation Commissioners
would have opposed the bill if the commission had not been
bankrupt; and this hypothetical opposition appeared to
have weight. If we may trust the reports, the House of
Commons listened with gravity to the assertion of one of
its members, that, if the Cerney springs were diverted,
“shoals and flats would be created.” Not a laugh nor a
cry of “Oh! oh,” appears to have been produced by the
prophecy, that the volume and scouring power of the Thames
would be seriously affected by taking away from it twelve
gallons per second! The whole quantity which these
springs supply would be delivered by a current moving
through a pipe one foot in diameter at the rate of less than
two miles per hour. Yet, when it was said that the navigability
of the Thames would be injuriously affected by
this deduction, there were no shouts of derision. On the
contrary, the House rejected the Cheltenham Water Bill by
a majority of one hundred and eighteen to eighty-eight. It
is true that the data were not presented in the above shape.
But the remarkable fact is that, even in the absence of a
specific comparison, it should not have been at once seen
that the water of springs which drain but a few square miles
at most, can be but an inappreciable part of the water which
runs out of the Thames basin, extending over several
thousand square miles. In itself, this is a matter of small
moment. It interests us here simply as an example of
legislative judgment. The decision is one of those small
holes through which a wide prospect may be seen, and a
disheartening prospect it is. In a very
simple case there <span class="xxpn" id="p390">{390}</span>
is here displayed a scarcely credible inability to see how
much effect will follow so much cause; and yet the business
of the assembly exhibiting this inability is that of dealing
with causes and effects of an extremely involved kind. All
the processes going on in society arise from the concurrences
and conflicts of human actions, which are determined
in their nature and amounts by the human constitution as
it now is—are as much results of natural causation as any
other results, and equally imply definite quantitative relations
between causes and effects. Every legislative act
presupposes a diagnosis and a prognosis; both of them
involving estimations of social forces and the work done by
them. Before it can be remedied, an evil must be traced
to its source in the motives and ideas of men as they are,
living under the social conditions which exist—a problem
requiring that the actions tending toward the result shall
be identified, and that there shall be something like a true
idea of the quantities of their effects as well as the qualities.
A further estimation has then to be made of the kinds and
degrees of influence that will be exerted by the additional
factors which the proposed law will set in motion: what
will be the resultants produced by the new forces coöperating
with preëxisting forces—a problem still more
complicated than the other.</p>

<p>We are quite prepared to hear the unhesitating reply,
that men incapable of forming an approximately true
judgment on a matter of simple physical causation may yet
be very good law-makers. So obvious will this be thought
by most, that a tacit implication to the contrary will seem
to them absurd; and that it will seem to them absurd
is one of the many indications of the profound ignorance
that prevails. It is true that mere empirical generalizations
which men draw from their dealings with their
fellows suffice to give them some ideas of the proximate
effects which new enactments will work; and, seeing these,
they think they see as far as needful.
Discipline in physical <span class="xxpn" id="p391">{391}</span>
science, however, would help to show them the futility of
calculating consequences based on such simple data. And
if there needs proof that calculations of consequences so
based are futile, we have it in the enormous labour annually
entailed on the Legislature in trying to undo the mischiefs
it has previously done.</p>

<p>Should any say that it is useless to dwell on this incompetency,
seeing that the House of Commons contains
the select of the nation, than whose judgments no better
are to be had, we reply that there may be drawn two
inferences which have important practical bearings. In
the first place, we are shown how completely the boasted
intellectual discipline of our upper classes fails to give them
the power of following out in thought, with any correctness,
the sequences of even simple phenomena, much less those
of complex phenomena. And, in the second place, we
may draw the corollary, that if the sequences of those complex
phenomena which societies display, difficult beyond all
others to trace out, are so unlikely to be understood by
them, they may advantageously be restricted in their interferences
with such sequences.</p>

<p>In one direction, especially, shall we see reason to resist
the extension of legislative action. There has of late been
urged the proposal that the class contemptuously described
as dividing its energies between business and bethels shall
have its education regulated by the class which might, with
equal justice, be described as dividing its energies between
club-rooms and game preserves. This scheme does not
seem to us a hopeful one. Considering that during the
last half century our society has been remoulded by ideas
that have come from the proposed pupil, and have had to
overcome the dogged resistance of the proposed teacher,
the propriety of the arrangement is not obvious. And if the
propriety of the arrangement is not obvious on the face of
it, still less obvious does it become when
the competency of <span class="xxpn" id="p392">{392}</span>
the proposed teacher comes to be measured. British
intelligence, as distilled through the universities and re-distilled
into the House of Commons, is a product admitting
of such great improvement in quality, that we should be
sorry to see the present method of manufacture extended
and permanently established.</p>

<h2 class="h2nobreak">POLITICAL FETICHISM.</h2></div>

<div class="dchappre">
<p class="pfirst">[<i>First published in</i>
The Reader <i>for June 10, 1865</i>.]</p></div>

<p>A Hindoo, who, before beginning his day’s work, salaams
to a bit of plastic clay, out of which, in a few moments, he
has extemporized a god in his own image, is an object
of amazement to the European. We read with surprise
bordering on scepticism of worship done by machinery,
and of prayers which owe their supposed efficacy to the
motion given by the wind to the papers they are written on.
When told how certain of the Orientals, if displeased with
their wooden deities, take them down and beat them, men
laugh and wonder.</p>

<p>Why should men wonder? Kindred superstitions are
exhibited by their fellows every day—superstitions that
are, indeed, not so gross, but are intrinsically of the same
nature. There is an idolatry which, instead of carving the
object of its worship out of dead matter, takes humanity
for its raw material, and expects, by moulding a mass of
this humanity into a particular form, to give it powers or
properties quite different from those it had before it was
moulded. In the one case as in the other, the raw material
is, as much as may be, disguised. There are decorative
appliances by which the savage helps himself to think that
he has something more than wood before
him; and the <span class="xxpn" id="p394">{394}</span>
citizen gives to the political agencies he has helped to
create, such imposing externals and distinctive names
expressive of power, as serve to strengthen his belief in
the benefits prayed for. Some faint reflection of that
“divinity” which “doth hedge a king” spreads down
through every state department to the lowest ranks; so
that, in the eyes of the people, even the policeman puts on
along with his uniform a certain indefinable power. Nay,
the mere dead symbols of authority excite reverence in
spite of better knowledge. A legal form of words seems to
have something especially binding in it; and there is a
preternatural efficiency about a government stamp.</p>

<p>The parallelism is still more conspicuous between the
persistency of faith in the two cases, notwithstanding perpetual
disappointments. It is difficult to perceive how
graven images, that have been thrashed for not responding
to their worshipper’s desires, should still be reverenced and
petitioned; but the difficulty of conceiving this is diminished
when we remember how, in their turns, all the idols in our
political pantheon undergo castigations for failing to do
what was expected of them, and are nevertheless daily
looked up to in the trustful hope that future prayers will be
answered. The stupidity, the slowness, the perversity, the
dishonesty of officialism, in one or other of its embodiments,
are demonstrated afresh in almost every newspaper that
issues. Probably half the leading articles written have for
texts some absurd official blunder, some exasperating official
delay, some astounding official corruption, some gross official
injustice, some incredible official extravagance. And yet
these whippings, in which balked expectation continually
vents itself, are immediately followed by renewed faith:
the benefits that have not come are still hoped for, and
prayers for others are put up. Along with proof that the
old State-machines are in themselves inert, and owe such
powers as they seem to have to the public opinion which
sets their parts in motion, there
are continually proposed <span class="xxpn" id="p395">{395}</span>
new State-machines of the same type as the old. This
inexhaustible credulity is counted on by men of the widest
political experience. Lord Palmerston, who probably
knows his public better than any other man, lately said, in
reply to a charge made in the House—“I am quite convinced
that no person belonging to the government, in
whatever department he may be, high or low, would be
guilty of any breach of faith in regard to any matter
confided to him.” To assert as much in the face of
facts continually disclosed, implies that Lord Palmerston
knows well that men’s faith in officialism survives all
adverse evidence.</p>

<p>In which case are the hopes from State-agency realized?
One might have thought that the vital interests at stake
would have kept the all-essential apparatus for administering
justice up to its work; but they do not. On the one
hand, here is a man wrongly convicted, and afterward
proved to be innocent, who is “pardoned” for an offence
he did not commit; and has this as consolation for his
unmerited suffering. On the other hand, here is a man
whose grave delinquencies a Lord Chancellor overlooks, on
partial restitution being made—nay, more, countenances
the granting of a pension to him. Proved guilt is rewarded,
while proved innocence is left without compensation for
pains borne and fortunes blasted! This marvellous antithesis,
if not often fully paralleled in the doings of officialism
as administrator of justice, is, in endless cases, paralleled
in part. The fact that imprisonment is the sentence on a
boy for stealing a pennyworth of fruit, while thousands of
pounds may be transferred from a public into a private
purse without any positive punishment being adjudged, is
an anomaly kept in countenance by numerous other judicial
acts. Theoretically, the State is a protector of the rights of
subjects; practically, the State continually plays the part
of aggressor. Though it is a recognized principle of equity
that he who makes a false charge shall pay the
costs of the <span class="xxpn" id="p396">{396}</span>
defence, yet, until quite recently, the Crown has persisted
in refusing to pay the costs of citizens against whom it has
brought false charges. Nay, worse, deliberate attempts
used to be made to establish charges by corrupt means.
Within the memory of those now living, the Crown, in
excise-prosecutions, bribed juries. When the verdict was
for the Crown, the custom was to give double fees; and the
practice was not put an end to until the counsel for a
defendant announced in open court that the jury should
have double fees if their verdict was for his client!</p>

<p>Not alone in the superior parts of our judicial apparatus
is this ill-working of officialism so thrust on men’s notice as
to have become proverbial; not alone in the life-long delays
and ruinous expenses which have made Chancery a word of
dread; not alone in the extravagances of bankruptcy courts,
which lead creditors carefully to shun them; not alone in
that uncertainty which makes men submit to gross injustice
rather than risk the still grosser injustice which the law
will, as likely as not, inflict on them; but down through the
lower divisions of the judicial apparatus are all kinds of
failures and absurdities daily displayed. If may be fairly
urged in mitigation of the sarcasms current respecting the
police, that among so many men cases of misconduct and
inefficiency must be frequent; but we might have expected
the orders under which they act to be just and well considered.
Very little inquiry shows that they are not.
There is a story current that, in the accounts of an Irish
official, a small charge for a telegram which an emergency
had called for, was objected to at the head office in London,
and, after a long correspondence, finally allowed, but with
the understanding that in future no such item would be
passed, unless the department in London had authorized it!
We cannot vouch for this story, but we can vouch for one
which gives credibility to it. A friend who had been
robbed by his cook went to the police-office, detailed the
case, gave good reasons for inferring the
direction of her <span class="xxpn" id="p397">{397}</span>
flight, and requested the police to telegraph, that she
might be intercepted. He was told, however, that they
could not do this without authority; and this authority was
not to be had without a long delay. The result was that
the thief, who had gone to the place supposed, escaped,
and has not since been heard of. Take another function
assumed by the police—the regulation of traffic. Daily,
all through London, ten thousand fast-going vehicles, with
hard-pressed men of business in them, are stopped by a
sprinkle of slow-going carts and wagons. Greater speed
in these comparatively few carts and wagons, or limitation
of them to early and late hours, would immensely diminish
the evil. But, instead of dealing with these really great
hinderances to traffic, the police deal with that which is
practically no hindrance. Men with advertisement-boards
were lately forbidden to walk about, on the groundless plea
that they are in the way; and incapables, prevented thus
from getting a shilling a day, were driven into the ranks of
paupers and thieves. Worse cases may be observed. For
years past there has been a feud between the police and
the orange-girls, who are chased hither and thither because
they are said to be obstructions to foot-passengers. Meanwhile,
in some of the chief thoroughfares, may constantly
be seen men standing with toys, which they delude children
and their parents into buying by pretending that the toys
make certain sounds which they themselves make; and
when the police, quietly watching this obtainment of money
under false pretences, are asked why they do not interfere,
they reply that they have no orders. Admirable contrast!
Trade dishonestly, and you may collect a small crowd on
the pavement without complaint being made that you
interrupt the traffic. Trade honestly, and you shall be
driven from the pavement-edge as an impediment—shall be
driven to dishonesty!</p>

<p>One might have thought that the notorious inefficiency
of officialism as a protector against
injustice would have <span class="xxpn" id="p398">{398}</span>
made men sceptical of its efficiency in other things. If
here, where citizens have such intense interests in getting
a function well discharged, they have failed through all
these centuries in getting it well discharged—if this
agency, which is in theory the guardian of each citizen, is
in so many cases his enemy, that going to law is suggestive
of impoverishment and possible ruin; it might have been
supposed that officialism would scarcely be expected to
work well where the interests at stake are less intense.
But so strong is political fetichism, that neither these
experiences, nor the parallel experiences which every state-department
affords, diminish men’s faith. For years past
there has been thrust before them the fact that, of the
funds of Greenwich Hospital, one-third goes to maintain
the sailors, while two-thirds go in ad­min­i­stra­tion; but this
and other such facts do not stop their advocacy of more
public ad­min­i­stra­tions. The parable of straining at gnats
and swallowing camels they see absolutely paralleled by
officialism, in the red-tape particularity with which all
minute regulations are enforced, and the astounding carelessness
with which the accounts of a whole department,
like the Patent Office, are left utterly uncontrolled; and
yet we continue to hear men propose government-audits
as checks for mercantile companies! No diminution of
confidence seems to result from disclosure of stupidities
which even a wild imagination would scarcely have thought
possible: instance the method of promotion lately made
public, under which a clerk in one branch of a department
takes the higher duties of some deceased superior clerk,
without any rise of salary, while some clerk in another
branch of the department gets the rise of salary without
any increase in his responsibilities!</p>

<p>Endless as are these evils and absurdities, and surviving
generation after generation as they do, spite of commissions
and reports and debates, there is an annual crop of
new schemes for government agencies
which are expected <span class="xxpn" id="p399">{399}</span>
to work just as legislators propose they shall work. With
a system of army-promotion which insures an organized
incompetence, but which survives perpetual protests; with
a notoriously ill-constituted admiralty, of which the doings
are stock-subjects of ridicule; with a church that maintains
effete formulas, notwithstanding almost universal repudiation
of them; there are daily demands for more law-established
appliances. With building acts under which
arise houses less stable than those of the last generation;
with coal-mine inspection that does not prevent coal-mine
explosions; with railway inspection that has for its
accompaniment plenty of railway accidents—with these
and other such failures continually displayed, there still
prevails what M. Guizot rightly calls that “gross delusion,
a belief in the sovereign power of political machinery.”</p>

<p>A great service would be done by any man who would
analyze the legislation, say of the last half century, and
compare the expected results of Acts of Parliament with
their proved results. He might make it an instructive
revelation by simply taking all the preambles, and observing
how many of the evils to be rectified were evils
produced by preceding enactments. His chief difficulty
would be that of getting within any moderate compass the
immense number of cases in which the benefits anticipated
were not achieved, while unanticipated disasters were
caused. And then he might effectively close his digest by
showing what immense advantages have, in instance after
instance, followed the entire cessation of legislative action.
Not, indeed, that such an accumulation of cases, however
multitudinous and however conclusive, would have an
appreciable effect on the average mind. Political fetichism
will continue so long as men remain without scientific
discipline—so long as they recognize only proximate
causes, and never think of the remoter and more general
causes by which their special agencies are set in motion.
Until the thing which now usurps the
name of education <span class="xxpn" id="p400">{400}</span>
has been dethroned by a true education, having for its end
to teach men the nature of the world they live in, new
political delusions will grow up as fast as old ones are
extinguished. But there is a select class existing, and a
larger select class arising, on whom a work of the kind
described would have an effect, and for whom it would be
well worth while
to write it.</p>

<p>It is contrary to common-sense that fish should be more
difficult to get at the sea-side than in London; but it is
true, nevertheless. No less contrary to common-sense
seems the truth that though, in the West Highlands, oxen
are to be seen everywhere, no beef can be had without
sending two or three hundred miles to Glasgow for it.
Rulers who, guided by common-sense, tried to suppress
certain opinions by forbidding the books containing them,
never dreamed that their interdicts would cause the
diffusion of these opinions; and rulers who, guided by
common-sense, forbade excessive rates of interest, never
dreamed that they were thereby making the terms harder
for borrowers than before. When printing replaced
copying, any one who had prophesied that the number
of persons engaged in the manufacture of books would
immensely increase, as a consequence, would have been
thought wholly devoid of common-sense. And equally
devoid of common-sense would have been thought any one
who, when railways were displacing coaches, said that the
number of horses employed in bringing passengers and
goods to and from railways, would be greater than the
number directly displaced by railways.
Such cases might <span class="xxpn" id="p402">{402}</span>
be multiplied. Whoso remembers that, among quite simple
phenomena, causes produce effects which are sometimes
utterly at variance with anticipation, will see how frequently
this must happen among complex phenomena. That a
balloon is made to rise by the same force which makes a
stone fall; that the melting of ice may be greatly retarded
by wrapping the ice in a blanket; that the simplest way of
setting potassium on fire is to throw it into the water; are
truths which those who know only the outside aspect of
things would regard as manifest falsehoods. And, if, when
the factors are few and simple, the results may be so
absolutely opposed to seeming probability, much more will
they be often thus opposed when the factors are many and
involved. The saying of the French respecting political
events, that “it is always the unexpected which happens”—a
saying which they have been abundantly re-illustrating
of late—is one which legislators, and those who urge on
schemes of legislation, should have ever in mind. Let us
pause a moment to contemplate a seemingly-impossible set
of results which social forces have wrought out.</p>

<p>Up to quite recent days, Language was held to be of
supernatural origin. That this elaborate apparatus of
symbols, so marvellously adapted for the conveyance of
thought from mind to mind, was a miraculous gift, seemed
unquestionable. No possible alternative way could be
thought of by which there had come into existence these
multitudinous assemblages of words of various orders,
genera, and species, moulded into fitness for articulating
with one another, and capable of being united from
moment to moment into ever-new combinations, which
represent with precision each idea as it arises. The
supposition that, in the slow progress of things, Language
grew out of the continuous use of signs—at first mainly
mimetic, afterward partly mimetic, partly vocal, and at
length almost wholly vocal—was an hypothesis never even
conceived by men in early stages of
civilization; and when <span class="xxpn" id="p403">{403}</span>
the hypothesis was at length conceived, it was thought
too monstrous an absurdity to be even entertained. Yet
this monstrous absurdity proves to be true. Already the
evolution of Language has been traced back far enough
to show that all its particular words, and all its leading
traits of structure, have had a natural genesis; and day
by day investigation makes it more manifest that its
genesis has been natural from the beginning. Not only
has it been natural from the beginning, but it has been
spontaneous. No language is a cunningly-devised scheme
of a ruler or body of legislators. There was no council
of savages to invent the parts of speech, and decide on
what principles they should be used. Nay, more. Going
on without any authority or appointed regulation, this
natural process went on without any man observing that
it was going on. Solely under pressure of the need for
communicating their ideas and feelings—solely in pursuit
of their personal interests—men little by little developed
speech in absolute unconsciousness that they were doing
any thing more than pursuing their personal interests.
Even now the unconsciousness continues. Take the
whole population of the globe, and there is probably not
above one in a million who knows that in his daily talk
he is carrying on the process by which Language has
been evolved.</p>

<p>I commence thus by way of giving the key-note to
the argument which follows. My general purpose, in
dwelling a moment on this illustration, has been that of
showing how utterly beyond the conceptions of common-sense,
literally so called, and even beyond the conceptions
of cultivated common-sense, are the workings-out of
sociological processes—how these workings-out are such
that even those who have carried to the uttermost “the
scientific use of the imagination,” would never have anticipated
them. And my more special purpose has been that
of showing how marvellous are the
results indirectly and <span class="xxpn" id="p404">{404}</span>
unintentionally achieved by the coöperation of men who
are severally pursuing their private ends. Let me pass
now to the particular topic to be here dealt with.</p>

<p class="padtopb">I have greatly regretted to see Prof. Huxley strengthening,
by his deservedly high authority, a school of
politicians which can scarcely be held to need strengthening:
its opponents being so few. I regret it the more
because, thus far, men prepared for the study of Sociology
by previous studies of Biology and Psychology, have
scarcely expressed any opinions on the question at issue;
and that Prof. Huxley, who by both general and special
culture is so eminently fitted to judge, should have come
to the conclusions set forth in the last number of the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i>, will be discouraging to the small
number who have reached opposite conclusions. Greatly
regretting however, though I do, this avowed antagonism
of Prof. Huxley to a general political doctrine with which
I am identified, I do not propose to make any reply to
his arguments at large: being deterred partly by reluctance
to dwell on points of difference with one whom I so
greatly admire, and partly by the consciousness that what
I should say would be mainly a repetition of what I have
explicitly or implicitly said elsewhere. But with one point
raised I feel obliged to deal. Prof. Huxley tacitly puts to
me a question. By so doing he leaves me to choose
between two alternatives, neither of which is agreeable to
me. I must either, by leaving it unanswered, accept the
implication that it is unanswerable, and the doctrine I hold
untenable; or else I must give it an adequate answer.
Little as I like it, I see that the latter of these alternatives
is that which, on public as well as on personal grounds, I
must accept.</p>

<p>Had I been allowed to elaborate more fully the Review-article
from which Prof. Huxley quotes, this question
would possibly not have been raised.
That article closes <span class="xxpn" id="p405">{405}</span>
with the following words:—“We had hoped to say something
respecting the different types of social organization,
and something also on social metamorphoses; but we have
reached our assigned limits.” These further developments
of the conception—developments to be hereafter set forth
in the <i>Principles of Sociology</i>—I must here sketch in
outline before my answer can be made intelligible. In
sketching them, I must say much that would be needless
were my answer addressed to Prof. Huxley only. Bare
allusions to general phenomena of organization, with which
he is immeasurably more familiar than I am, would suffice.
But, as the sufficiency of my answer has to be judged by
the general reader, the general reader must be supplied
with the requisite data: my presentation of them being
under correction from Prof. Huxley if it is inaccurate.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The primary dif­fer­en­tia­tion in organic structures, manifested
alike in the history of each organism and in the
history of the organic world as a whole, is the dif­fer­en­tia­tion
between outer and inner parts—the parts which hold direct
converse with the environment and the parts which do
not hold direct converse with the environment. We see
this alike in those smallest and lowest forms improperly,
though suggestively, sometimes called unicellular, and also
in the next higher division of creatures which, with
considerable reason, are regarded as aggregations of the
lower. In these creatures the body is divisible into endoderm
and ectoderm, differing very little in their characters,
but serving the one to form the digestive sac, and the
other to form the outer wall of the body. As Prof. Huxley
describes them in his <i>Oceanic Hydrozoa</i>, these layers represent
respectively the organs of nutrition and the organs
of external relation—generally, though not universally;
for there are exceptions, especially among parasites. In
the embryos of higher types, these two layers severally
become double by the splitting of a
layer formed between <span class="xxpn" id="p406">{406}</span>
them; and from the outer double layer is developed the
body-wall with its limbs, nervous system, senses, muscles,
etc.; while from the inner double layer there arise the
alimentary canal and its appendages, together with the
heart and lungs. Though in such higher types these two
systems of organs, which respectively absorb nutriment
and expend nutriment, become so far connected by ramifying
blood-vessels and nerves that this division cannot
be sharply made, still the broad contrast remains. At
the very outset, then, there arises this separation, which
implies at once a coöperation and an antagonism—a co-operation,
because, while the outer organs secure for the
inner organs the crude food, the inner organs elaborate
and supply to the outer organs the prepared materials by
which they are enable to do their work; and an antagonism,
because each set of organs, living and growing at the cost
of these prepared materials, cannot appropriate any portion
of the total supply without diminishing by so much the
supply available for the other. This general coöperation
and general antagonism becomes complicated with special
coöperations and special antagonisms, as fast as these two
great systems of organs develop. The originally simple
alimentary canal, differentiating into many parts, becomes
a congeries of structures which, by coöperation, fulfil
better their general function, but between which there
nevertheless arise antagonisms; since each has to make
good its waste and to get matter for growth, at the cost of
the general supply of nutriment available for them all.
Similarly, as fast as the outer system develops into special
senses and limbs, there arise among these, also, secondary
coöperations and secondary antagonisms. By their variously-combined
actions, food is obtained more effectually; and
yet the activity of each set of muscles, or each directive
nervous structure, entails a draft upon the stock of prepared
nutriment which the outer organs receive, and is
by so much at the cost of the rest. Thus
the method of <span class="xxpn" id="p407">{407}</span>
organization, both in general and in detail, is a simultaneous
combination and opposition. All the organs unite in
subserving the interests of the organism they form; and
yet they have all their special interests, and compete with
one another for blood.</p>

<p>A form of government, or control, or coördination,
develops as fast as these systems of organs develop.
Eventually this becomes double. A general distinction
arises between the two controlling systems belonging to
the two great systems of organs. Whether the inner controlling
system is or is not originally derived from the
outer, matters not to the argument—when developed it is
in great measure independent.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn37" id="fnanch37">37</a>
If we contemplate their
respective sets of functions, we shall perceive the origin of
this distinction. That the outer organs may coöperate
effectively for the purposes of catching prey, escaping
danger, etc., it is needful that they should be under a
government capable of directing their combined actions,
now in this way and now in that, according as outer
circumstances vary. From instant to instant there must
be quick adjustments to occasions that are more or less
new; and hence there requires a complex and centralized
nervous apparatus, to which all these organs are promptly
and completely obedient. The government
needful for the <span class="xxpn" id="p408">{408}</span>
inner system of organs is a different and much simpler one.
When the food obtained by the outer organs has been put
into the stomach, the coöperation required of the viscera,
though it varies somewhat as the quantity or kind of food
varies, has nevertheless a general uniformity; and it is
required to go on in much the same way whatever the
outer circumstances may be. In each case the food has
to be reduced to a pulp, supplied with various solvent
secretions, propelled onward, and its nutritive part taken
up by absorbent surfaces. That these processes may be
effective, the organs which carry them on must be supplied
with fit blood; and to this end the heart and the lungs
have to act with greater vigor. This visceral coöperation,
carried on with this comparative uniformity, is regulated
by a nervous system which is to a large extent independent
of that higher and more complex nervous system controlling
the external organs. The act of swallowing is, indeed,
mainly effected by the higher nervous system; but, being
swallowed, the food affects by its presence the local nerves,
through them the local ganglia, and indirectly, through
nervous connexions with other ganglia, excites the rest of
the viscera into coöperative activity. It is true that the
functions of the sympathetic or ganglionic nervous system,
or “nervous system of organic life,” as it is otherwise
called, are imperfectly understood. But, since we know
positively that some of its plexuses, as the cardiac, are
centres of local stimulation and coördination, which can
act independently, though they are influenced by higher
centres, it is fairly to be inferred that the other and still
larger plexuses, distributed among the viscera, are also
such local and largely independent centres; especially as
the nerves they send into the viscera, to join the many
subordinate ganglia distributed through them, greatly exceed
in quantity the cerebro-spinal fibres ac­com­pa­ny­ing
them. Indeed, to suppose otherwise is to leave unanswered
the question—What are their functions? as
well as the <span class="xxpn" id="p409">{409}</span>
question—How are these unconscious visceral coördinations
effected? There remains only to observe the kind of co-operation
which exists between the two nervous systems.
This is both a general and a special coöperation. The
general coöperation is that by which either system of
organs is enabled to stimulate the other to action. The
alimentary canal yields through certain nervous connexions
the sensation of hunger to the higher nervous system;
and so prompts efforts for procuring food. Conversely,
the activity of the nervo-muscular system, or, at least, its
normal activity, sends inward to the cardiac and other
plexuses a gush of stimulus which excites the viscera to
action. The special coöperation is one by which it would
seem that each system puts an indirect restraint on the
other. Fibres from the sympathetic accompany every artery
throughout the organs of external relation, and exercise
on the artery a constrictive action; and the converse is
done by certain of the cerebro-spinal fibres which ramify
with the sympathetic throughout the viscera: through the
vagus and other nerves, an inhibitory influence is exercised
on the heart, intestines, pancreas, etc. Leaving doubtful
details, however, the fact which concerns us here is sufficiently
manifest. There are, for these two systems of organs, two
nervous systems, in great measure independent; and, if it
is true that the higher system influences the lower, it is no
less true that the lower very powerfully influences the
higher. The restrictive action of the sympathetic upon the
circulation, throughout the nervo-muscular system, is unquestionable;
and it is possibly through this that, when
the viscera have much work to do, the nervo-muscular
system is incapacitated in so marked a manner.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn38" id="fnanch38">38</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch37" id="fn37">37</a>
Here, and throughout the discussion, I refer to these
controlling systems only as they exist in the <i>Vertebrata</i>, because
their relations are far better known in this great division of the
animal kingdom—not because like relations do not exist elsewhere.
Indeed, in the great sub-kingdom <i>Annulosa</i>, these controlling systems
have relations that are extremely significant to us here. For while an
inferior annulose animal has only a single set of nervous structures,
a superior annulose animal (as a moth) has a set of nervous structures
presiding over the viscera, as well as a more conspicuous set presiding
over the organs of external relation. And this contrast is analogous to
one of the contrasts between undeveloped and developed societies; for,
while among the uncivilized and incipiently civilized there is but a
single set of directive agencies, there are among the fully civilized,
as we shall presently see, two sets of directive agencies, for the
outer and inner structures respectively.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch38" id="fn38">38</a>
To meet the probable objection that the experiments of
Bernard, Ludwig, and others, show that in the case of certain glands
the nerves of the cerebro-spinal system are those which set up the
secreting process, I would remark that in these cases, and in many
others where the relative functions of the cerebro-spinal nerves and
the sympathetic nerves have been studied, the
organs have been those in which <i>sensation</i> is either the
stimulus to activity or its accompaniment; and that from these cases no
conclusion can be drawn applying to the cases of those viscera which
normally perform their functions without sensation. Perhaps it may
even be that the functions of those sympathetic fibres which accompany
the arteries of the outer organs are simply ancillary to those of the
central parts of the sympathetic system, which stimulate and regulate
the viscera—ancillary in this sense, that they check the diffusion
of blood in external organs when it is wanted in internal organs:
cerebro-spinal inhibition (except in its action on the heart) working
the opposite way. And possibly this is the instrumentality for carrying
on that competition for nutriment which, as we saw, arises at the very
outset between these two great systems of organs.</p></div>

<p>The one further fact here concerning
us is the contrast <span class="xxpn" id="p410">{410}</span>
presented in different kinds of animals, between the degrees
of development of these two great sets of structures that
carry on respectively the outer functions and the inner
functions. There are active creatures in which the locomotive
organs, the organs of sense, together with the
nervous apparatus which combines their actions, bear a
large ratio to the organs of alimentation and their appendages;
while there are inactive creatures in which these
organs of external relation bear a very small ratio to the
organs of alimentation. And a remarkable fact, here
especially instructive to us, is that very frequently there
occurs a metamorphosis, which has for its leading trait a
great change in the ratio of these two systems—a metamorphosis
which accompanies a great change in the mode
of life. The most familiar metamorphosis is variously
illustrated among insects. During the early or larval
stage of a butterfly, the organs of alimentation are largely
developed, while the organs of external relation are but
little developed; and then, during a period of quiescence,
the organs of external relation undergo an immense development,
making possible the creature’s active and varied
adjustments to the surrounding world, while the alimentary
system becomes relatively small. On the other hand, among
the lower invertebrate animals there is a very common
metamorphosis of an opposite kind. When young, the
creature, with scarcely any alimentary
system, but supplied <span class="xxpn" id="p411">{411}</span>
with limbs and sense organs, swims about actively. Presently
it settles in a <i>habitat</i> where food is to be obtained
without moving about, loses in great part its organs of
external relation, develops its visceral system, and, as it
grows, assumes a nature utterly unlike that which it originally
had—a nature adapted almost exclusively to alimentation
and the propagation of the species.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Let us turn now to the social organism, and the analogies
of structure and function which may be traced in it. Of
course these analogies between the phenomena presented
in a physically coherent aggregate forming an individual,
and the phenomena presented in a physically incoherent
aggregate of individuals distributed over a wide area,
cannot be analogies of a visible or sensible kind; but can
only be analogies between the systems, or methods, of
organization. Such analogies as exist result from the one
unquestionable community between the two organizations:
<i>there is in both a mutual dependence of parts</i>. This is the
origin of all organization; and determines what similarities
there are between an individual organism and a social
organism. Of course the similarities thus determined are
accompanied by transcendent differences, determined, as
above said, by the unlikenesses of the aggregates. One
cardinal difference is that, while in the individual organism
there is but one centre of consciousness capable of pleasure
or pain, there are, in the social organism, as many such
centres as there are individuals, and the aggregate of them
has no consciousness of pleasure or pain—a difference
which entirely changes the ends to be pursued. Bearing
in mind this qualification, let us now glance at the
parallelisms indicated.</p>

<p>A society, like an individual, has a set of structures
fitting it to act upon its environment—appliances for attack
and defence, armies, navies, fortified and garrisoned places.
At the same time, a society has
an industrial organization <span class="xxpn" id="p412">{412}</span>
which carries on all those processes that make possible the
national life. Though these two sets of organs for external
activity and internal activity do not bear to one another
just the same relation which the outer and inner organs of
an animal do (since the industrial structures in a society
supply themselves with raw materials, instead of being
supplied by the external organs), yet they bear a relation
otherwise similar. There is at once a coöperation and an
antagonism. By the help of the defensive system the
industrial system is enabled to carry on its functions without
injury from foreign enemies; and by the help of the
industrial system, which supplies it with food and materials,
the defensive system is enabled to maintain this security.
At the same time the two systems are opposed in so far
that they both depend for their existence upon the common
stock of produce. Further, in the social organism, as in
the individual organism, this primary coöperation and
antagonism subdivides into secondary coöperations and
antagonisms. If we look at the industrial organization,
we see that its agricultural part and its manufacturing
part aid one another by the exchange of their products,
and are yet otherwise opposed to one another; since each
takes of the other’s products the most it can get in return
for its own products. Similarly throughout the manufacturing
system itself. Of the total returns secured by
Manchester for its goods, Liverpool obtains as much as
possible for the raw material, and Manchester gives as
little as possible—the two at the same time coöperating
in secreting for the rest of the community the woven
fabrics it requires, and in jointly obtaining from the rest of
the community the largest payment in other commodities.
And thus it is in all kinds of direct and indirect ways
throughout the industrial structures. Men prompted by
their own needs as well as those of their children, and
bodies of such men more or less aggregated, are quick to
find every unsatisfied need of their
fellow-men, and to <span class="xxpn" id="p413">{413}</span>
satisfy it in return for the satisfaction of their own needs;
and the working of this process is inevitably such that the
strongest need, ready to pay the most for satisfaction, is
that which draws most workers to satisfy it, so that there
is thus a perpetual balancing of the needs and of the appliances
which subserve them.</p>

<p>This brings us to the regulative structures under which
these two systems of coöperating parts work. As in the
individual organism, so in the social organism, the outer
parts are under a rigorous central control. For adjustment
to the varying and incalculable changes in the environment,
the external organs, offensive and defensive, must
be capable of prompt combination; and that their actions
may be quickly combined to meet each exigency as it
arises, they must be completely subordinated to a supreme
executive power: armies and navies must be despotically
controlled. Quite otherwise is it with the regulative
apparatus required for the industrial system. This, which
carries on the nutrition of a society, as the visceral system
carries on the nutrition of an individual, has a regulative
apparatus in great measure distinct from that which
regulates the external organs. It is not by any “order
in council” that farmers are determined to grow so much
wheat and so much barley, or to divide their land in due
proportion between arable and pasture. There requires
no telegram from the Home Office to alter the production
of woollens in Leeds, so that it may be properly adjusted
to the stocks on hand and the forthcoming crop of wool.
Staffordshire produces its due quantity of pottery, and
Sheffield sends out cutlery with rapidity adjusted to the
consumption, without any legislative stimulus or restraint.
The spurs and checks to production which manufacturers
and manufacturing centres receive, have quite another
origin. Partly by direct orders from distributors and
partly by the indirect indications furnished by the market
reports throughout the kingdom, they
are prompted to <span class="xxpn" id="p414">{414}</span>
secrete actively or to diminish their rates of secretion.
The regulative apparatus by which these industrial organs
are made to coöperate harmoniously, acts somewhat as the
sympathetic does in a vertebrate animal. There is a
system of communications among the great producing
and distributing centres, which excites or retards as the
circumstances vary. From hour to hour messages pass
between all the chief provincial towns, as well as between
each of them and London; from hour to hour prices are
adjusted, supplies are ordered hither or thither, and
capital is drafted from place to place, according as there
is greater or less need for it. All this goes on without
any ministerial overseeing—without any dictation from
those executive centres which combine the actions of
the outer organs. There is, however, one all-essential
influence which these higher centres exercise over the
industrial activities—a restraining influence which prevents
aggression, direct and indirect. The condition under
which only these producing and distributing processes can
go on healthfully, is that, wherever there is work and
waste, there shall be a proportionate supply of materials
for repair. And securing this is nothing less than securing
fulfilment of contracts. Just in the same way that a
bodily organ which performs function, but is not adequately
paid in blood, must dwindle, and the organism as a whole
eventually suffer; so an industrial centre which has made
and sent out its special commodity, but does not get
adequately paid in other commodities, must decay. And
when we ask what is requisite to prevent this local
innutrition and decay, we find the requisite to be that
agreements shall be carried out; that goods shall be
paid for at the stipulated prices; that justice shall
be administered.</p>

<p>One further leading parallelism must be described—that
between the metamorphoses which occur in the two
cases. These metamorphoses are analogous in
so far that <span class="xxpn" id="p415">{415}</span>
they are changes in the ratios of the inner and outer
systems of organs; and also in so far as they take place
under analogous conditions. At the one extreme we have
that small and simple type of society which a wandering
horde of savages presents. This is a type almost wholly
predatory in its organization. It consists of little else
than a coöperative structure for carrying on warfare—the
industrial part is almost absent, being represented only by
the women. When the wandering tribe becomes a settled
tribe, an industrial organization begins to show itself—especially
where, by conquest, there has been obtained a
slave-class that may be forced to labour. The predatory
structure, however, still for a long time predominates.
Omitting the slaves and the women, the whole body politic
consists of parts organized for offence and defence, and is
efficient in proportion as the control of them is centralized.
Communities of this kind, continuing to subjugate their
neighbours, and developing an organization of some complexity,
nevertheless retain a mainly-predatory type, with
just such industrial structures as are needful for supporting
the offensive and defensive structures. Of this Sparta
furnished a good example. The char­ac­ter­is­tics of such a
social type are these—that each member of the ruling
race is a soldier; that war is the business of life; that
every one is subject to a rigorous discipline fitting him for
this business; that centralized authority regulates all the
social activities, down to the details of each man’s daily
conduct; that the welfare of the State is every thing, and
that the individual lives for public benefit. So long as
the environing societies are such as necessitate and keep
in exercise the militant organization, these traits continue;
but when, mainly by conquest and the formation of large
aggregates, the militant activity becomes less constant,
and war ceases to be the occupation of every free man,
the industrial structures begin to predominate. Without
tracing the transition, it will suffice to take,
as a sample <span class="xxpn" id="p416">{416}</span>
of the pacific or industrial type, the Northern States of
America before the late war. Here military organization
had almost disappeared; the infrequent local assemblings
of militia had turned into occasions for jollity, and every
thing martial had fallen into contempt. The traits of
the pacific or industrial type are these—that the central
authority is relatively feeble; that it interferes scarcely
at all with the private actions of individuals; and that
the State, instead of being that for the benefit of which
individuals exist, has become that which exists for the
benefit of individuals.</p>

<p>It remains to add that this metamorphosis, which takes
place in societies along with a higher civilization, very
rapidly retrogrades if the surrounding conditions become
unfavorable to it. During the late war in America, Mr.
Seward’s boast—“I touch this bell, and any man in the
remotest State is a prisoner of the Government” (a boast
which was not an empty one, and which was by many of
the Republican party greatly applauded)—shows us how
rapidly, along with militant activities, there tends to be
resumed the needful type of centralized structure; and
how there quickly grow up the corresponding sentiments
and ideas. Our own history since 1815 has shown a
double change of this kind. During the thirty years’
peace, the militant organization dwindled, the military
sentiment greatly decreased, the industrial organization
rapidly developed, the assertion of the individuality of the
citizen became more decided, and many restrictive and
despotic regulations were got rid of. Conversely, since
the revival of militant activities and structures on the
Continent, our own offensive and defensive structures
have been re-developing; and the tendency toward increase
of that centralized control which accompanies such structures
has become marked.</p>

<p class="padtopb">And now, closing this
somewhat elaborate introduction, <span class="xxpn" id="p417">{417}</span>
I am prepared to deal with the question put to me. Prof.
Huxley, after quoting some passages from that essay on
the “Social Organism” which I have supplemented in the
foregoing paragraphs; and after expressing a qualified
concurrence which I greatly value as coming from so highly
fitted a judge, proceeds, with characteristic acumen, to
comment on what seems an incongruity between certain
analogies set forth in that essay, and the doctrine I hold
respecting the duty of the State. Referring to a passage
in which I have described the function of the individual
brain as “that of <i>averaging</i> the interests of life, physical,
intellectual, moral, social,” and have compared it to the
function of Parliament as “that of <i>averaging</i> the interests
of the various classes in a community,” adding that “a
good Parliament is one in which the parties answering to
these respective interests are so balanced that their united
legislation concedes to each class as much as consists with
the claims of the rest;” Prof. Huxley proceeds to say:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“All this appears to be very just. But if the resemblances between the
body physiological and the body politic are any indication, not only of what
the latter is, and how it has become what it is, but what it ought to be, and
what it is tending to become, I cannot but think that the real force of the
analogy is totally opposed to the negative view of State function.</p>

<p>“Suppose that, in accordance with this view, each muscle were to
maintain that the nervous system had no right to interfere with its
contraction, except to prevent it from hindering the contraction of another
muscle; or each gland, that it had a right to secrete, so long as its secretion
interfered with no other; suppose every separate cell left free to follow
its own “interests,” and <i>laissez-faire</i> Lord of all, what would become of the
body physiological?”</p></blockquote>

<p>On this question the remark I have first to make is, that
if I held the doctrine of M. Proudhon, who deliberately
named himself an “anarchist,” and if along with this
doctrine I held the above-indicated theory of social
structures and functions, the inconsistency implied by the
question put would be clear, and the question would be
unanswerable. But since I entertain no such view as that of
Proudhon—since I hold that within
its proper limits <span class="xxpn" id="p418">{418}</span>
governmental action is not simply legitimate but all-important—I
do not see how I am concerned with a question which
tacitly supposes that I deny the legitimacy and the importance.
Not only do I contend that the restraining power
of the State over individuals, and bodies or classes of
individuals, is requisite, but I have contended that it should
be exercised much more effectually, and carried out much
further, than at present.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn39" id="fnanch39">39</a>
And as the maintenance of this
control implies the maintenance of a controlling apparatus,
I do not see that I am placed in any difficulty when I am
asked what would happen were the controlling apparatus
forbidden to interfere. Further, on this general aspect of
the question I have to say that, by comparing the deliberative
assembly of a nation to the deliberative nervous centre of a
vertebrate animal, as respectively averaging the interests
of the society and of the individual, and as both doing this
through processes of representation, I do not mean to
<i>identify</i> the two sets of interests; for these in a society (or
at least a peaceful society) refer mainly to interior actions,
while in an individual creature they refer mainly to exterior
actions. The “interests” to which I refer, as being
averaged by a rep­re­sen­ta­tive governing body, are the
conflicting interests between class and class, as well as
between man and man—conflicting interests the balancing
of which is nothing but the preventing of aggression and
the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice.</p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch39" id="fn39">39</a>
See <i>Social Statics</i> chap. xxi.,
“The Duty of the State.” See also essay
on “Over-Legislation.”</p></div>

<p>I pass now from this general aspect of the question,
which does not concern me, to a more special aspect which
does concern me. Dividing the actions of governing structures,
whether in bodies individual or bodies politic, into
the <i>positively regulative</i> and the <i>negatively regulative</i>, or
those which stimulate and direct, as distinguished from
those which simply restrain, I may say that if there is
raised the question—What will happen
when the controlling <span class="xxpn" id="p419">{419}</span>
apparatus does not act? there are quite different replies
according as one or other system of organs is referred to.
If, in the individual body, the muscles were severally
independent of the deliberative and executive centres, utter
impotence would result: in the absence of muscular
coördination, there would be no possibility of standing,
much less of acting on surrounding things, and the body
would be a prey to the first enemy. Properly to combine
the actions of these outer organs, the great nervous centres
must exercise functions that are both positively regulative
and negatively regulative—must both command action and
arrest action. Similarly with the outer organs of a political
body. Unless the offensive and defensive structures can
be despotically commanded by a central authority, there
cannot be those prompt combinations and adjustments
required for meeting the variable actions of external
enemies. But if, instead of asking what would happen
supposing the outer organs in either case were without
control from the great governing centres, we ask what
would happen were the inner organs (the industrial and
commercial structures in the one case, and the alimentary
and distributive in the other) without such control, the
answer is quite different. Omitting the respiratory and
some minor ancillary parts of the individual organism, to
which the social organism has nothing analogous; and
limiting ourselves to absorptive, elaborative, and distributive
structures, which are found in both; it may, I think, be
successfully contended that in neither the one case nor the
other do they require the positively regulative control of
the great governing centres, but only the negatively
regulative. Let us glance at the facts.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn40" id="fnanch40">40</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch40" id="fn40">40</a>
Lest there should be any misunderstanding of the terms <i>positively
regulative</i> and <i>negatively regulative</i>, let me briefly illustrate them. If a man
has land, and I either cultivate it for him, partially or wholly, or dictate any
or all of his modes of cultivation, my action is positively regulative; but if,
leaving him absolutely unhelped and unregulated in his
farming, I simply prevent him from taking his neighbour’s crops, or from making approach-roads
over his neighbour’s land, or from depositing rubbish upon it, my action is
negatively regulative. There is a tolerably sharp distinction between the act
of securing a citizen’s ends for him or interfering with his mode of securing
them, and the act of checking him when he interferes with another citizen
in the pursuit
of his ends.</p></div>

<p>Digestion and circulation go on very
well in lunatics <span class="xxpn" id="p420">{420}</span>
and idiots, though the higher nervous centres are either
deranged or partly absent. The vital functions proceed
properly during sleep, though less actively than when the
brain is at work. In infancy, while the cerebro-spinal
system is almost incapable, and cannot even perform such
simple actions as those of commanding the sphincters, the
visceral functions are active and regular. Nor in an adult
does that arrest of cerebral action shown by insensibility,
or that extensive paralysis of the spinal system which
renders all the limbs immovable, prevent these functions
from being carried on for a considerable time; though they
necessarily begin to flag in the absence of the demand
which an active system of outer organs makes upon them.
These internal organs are, indeed, so little under the
positively directive control of the great nervous centres,
that their independence is often very inconvenient. No
mandate sent into the interior stops an attack of diarrhœa;
nor, when an indigestible meal excites the circulation at
night, and prevents sleep, will the bidding of the brain
cause the heart to pulsate more quietly. It is doubtless
true that these vital processes are modified in important
ways, both by general stimulation and by inhibition, from
the cerebro-spinal system; but that they are mainly independent
cannot, I think, be questioned. The facts that
peristaltic motion of the intestines can go on when their
nervous connexions are cut, and that the heart (in cold-blooded
vertebrates, at least) continues to pulsate for some
time after being detached from the body, make it manifest
that the spontaneous activities of these vital organs subserve
the wants of the body at large without direction from
its higher governing centres.
And this is made even <span class="xxpn" id="p421">{421}</span>
more manifest if it be a fact, as alleged by Schmulewitsch
experimenting under Ludwig’s direction, that, under duly-adjusted
conditions, the secretion of bile may be kept up
for some time when blood is passed through the excised
liver of a newly-killed rabbit. There is an answer, not, I
think, unsatisfactory, even to the crucial part of the question—“Suppose
every separate cell left free to follow its
own interests, and <i>laissez faire</i> Lord of all, what would
become of the body physiological?” Limiting the application
of this question in the way above shown to the organs
and parts of organs which carry on vital actions, it seems
to me that much evidence may be given for the belief that,
when they follow their respective “interests” (limited here
to growing and multiplying), the general welfare will be
tolerably well secured. It was proved by Hunter’s experiments
on a kite and a sea-gull, that a part of the alimentary
canal which has to triturate harder food than that which the
creature naturally eats, acquires a thicker and harder lining.
When a stricture of the intestine impedes the passage of its
contents, the muscular walls of the intestine above, thicken
and propel the contents with greater force. When there
is somewhere in the course of the circulation a serious resistance
to the passage of blood, there habitually occurs
hypertrophy of the heart, or thickening of its muscular
walls; giving it greater power to propel the blood. And
similarly, when the duct through which it discharges its
contents is obstructed, the gall-bladder thickens and
strengthens. These changes go on without any direction
from the brain—without any consciousness that they are
going on. They are effected by the growth, or multiplication,
or adaptation, of the local units, be they cells or fibres,
which results from the greater action or modified action
thrown upon them. The only pre-requisite to this spontaneous
adaptive change is, that these local units shall be
supplied with extra blood in proportion as they perform
extra function—a pre-requisite answering
to that secured <span class="xxpn" id="p422">{422}</span>
by the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice in a society; namely, that
more work shall bring more pay. If, however, direct proof
be called for that a system of organs may, by carrying on
their several independent activities uncontrolled, secure the
welfare of the aggregate they form, we have it in that
extensive class of creatures which do not possess any
nervous systems at all; and which nevertheless show, some
of them, considerable degrees of activity. The Oceanic
Hydrozoa supply good examples. Notwithstanding “the
multiplicity and complexity of the organs which some of
them possess,” these creatures have no nervous centres—no
regulative apparatus by which the actions of their organs
are coördinated. One of their higher kinds is composed of
different parts distinguished as cœnosarc, polypites, tentacles,
hydrocysts, nectocalyces, genocalyces, etc., and each
of these different parts is composed of many partially-independent
units—thread-cells, ciliated cells, contractile
fibres, etc.; so that the whole organism is a group of
heterogeneous groups, each one of which is itself a more or
less heterogeneous group. And, in the absence of a nervous
system, the arrangement must necessarily be such that these
different units, and different groups of units, severally
pursuing their individual lives without positive direction
from the rest, nevertheless do, by virtue of their constitutions,
and the relative positions into which they have grown,
coöperate for the maintenance of one another and the entire
aggregate. And if this can be so with a set of organs that
are not connected by nerves, much more can it be so with a
set of organs which, like the viscera of a higher animal,
have a special set of nervous communications for exciting
one another to coöperation.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the parallel classes of phenomena
which the social organism presents. In it, as in the
individual organism, we find that while the system of
external organs must be rigorously subordinated to a great
governing centre which positively regulates
it, the system <span class="xxpn" id="p423">{423}</span>
of internal organs needs no such positive regulation. The
production and interchange by which the national life is
maintained, go on as well while Parliament is not sitting as
while it is sitting. When the members of the Ministry are
following grouse or stalking deer, Liverpool imports,
Manchester manufactures, London distributes, just as
usual. All that is needful for the normal performance of
these internal social functions is, that the restraining or
inhibitory structures shall continue in action: these
activities of individuals, corporate bodies, and classes, must
be carried on in such ways as not to transgress certain conditions,
necessitated by the simultaneous carrying on of
other activities. So long as order is maintained, and the
fulfilment of contracts is everywhere enforced—so long as
there is secured to each citizen, and each combination of
citizens, the full return agreed upon for work done or commodities
produced; and so long as each may enjoy what he
obtains by labour, without trenching on his neighbour’s like
ability to enjoy; these functions will go on healthfully—more
healthfully, indeed, than when regulated in any other
way. Fully to recognize this fact, it is needful only to look
at the origins and actions of the leading industrial structures.
We will take two of them, the most remote from one
another in their natures.</p>

<p>The first shall be those by which food is produced and
distributed. In the fourth of his <i>Introductory Lectures on
Political Economy</i>, Archbishop Whately remarks that:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“Many of the most important objects are accomplished by the joint
agency of persons who never think of them, nor have any idea of acting in
concert; and that, with a certainty, completeness, and regularity, which
probably the most diligent benevolence, under the guidance of the greatest
human wisdom, could never have attained.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To enforce this truth he goes on to say:—“Let any one
propose to himself the problem of supplying with daily
provisions of all kinds such a city as our metropolis,
containing above a million of inhabitants.” And then he
points out the many immense difficulties
of the task <span class="xxpn" id="p424">{424}</span>
caused by inconstancy in the arrival of supplies; by the
perishable nature of many of the commodities; by the
fluctuating number of consumers; by the heterogeneity
of their demands; by variations in the stocks, immediate
and remote, and the need for adjusting the rate of consumption;
and by the complexity in the process of
distribution required to bring due quantities of these
many commodities to the homes of all citizens. And,
having dwelt on these many difficulties, he finishes his
picture by saying:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“Yet this object is accomplished far better than it could be by any effort
of human wisdom, through the agency of men who think each of nothing
beyond his own immediate interest—who, with that object in view, perform
their respective parts with cheerful zeal—and combine unconsciously to
employ the wisest means for effecting an object, the vastness of which it
would bewilder them even to contemplate.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But though the far-spreading and complex organization
by which foods of all kinds are produced, prepared, and
distributed throughout the entire kingdom, is a natural
growth and not a State-manufacture; though the State
does not determine where and in what quantities cereals
and cattle and sheep shall be reared; though it does not
arrange their respective prices so as to make supplies last
until fresh supplies can come; though it has done nothing
toward causing that great improvement of quality which
has taken place in food since early times; though it has
not the credit of that elaborate apparatus by which bread,
and meat, and milk, come round to our doors with a daily
pulse that is as regular as the pulse of the heart; yet the
State has not been wholly passive. It has from time to
time done a great deal of mischief. When Edward I.
forbade all towns to harbour forestallers, and when
Edward VI. made it penal to buy grain for the purpose of
selling it again, they were preventing the process by which
consumption is adjusted to supply: they were doing all
that could be done to insure alternations of abundance and
starvation. Similarly with the
many legislative attempts <span class="xxpn" id="p425">{425}</span>
since made to regulate one branch or other of the food-industry,
down to the corn-law sliding-scale of odious
memory. For the marvellous efficiency of this organization
we are indebted to private enterprise; while the derangements
of it we owe to the positively-regulative action of
the Government. Meanwhile, its negatively-regulative
action, required to keep this organization in order, Government
has not duly performed. A quick and costless
remedy for breach of contract, when a trader sells, as the
commodity asked for, what proves to be wholly or in part
some other commodity, is still wanting.</p>

<p>Our second case shall be the organization which so
immensely facilitates commerce by transfers of claims and
credits. Banks were not inventions of rulers or their
counsellors. They grew up by small stages out of the
transactions of traders with one another. Men who for
security deposited money with goldsmiths, and took
receipts; goldsmiths who began to lend out at interest
the moneys left with them, and then to offer interest at
lower rates to those who would deposit money; were the
founders of them. And when, as presently happened, the
receipt-notes became transferable by indorsement, banking
commenced. From that stage upward the development,
notwithstanding many hinderances, has gone on naturally.
Banks have sprung up under the same stimulus which has
produced all other kinds of trading bodies. The multiplied
forms of credit have been gradually differentiated from the
original form; and while the banking system has spread
and become complex, it has also become consolidated into
a whole by a spontaneous process. The clearing-house,
which is a place for carrying on the banking between
bankers, arose unobtrusively out of an effort to economize
time and money. And when, in 1862, Sir John Lubbock—not
in his legislative capacity but in his capacity as
banker—succeeded in extending the privileges of the
clearing-house to country banks, the
unification was made <span class="xxpn" id="p426">{426}</span>
perfect; so that now the transactions of any trader in
the kingdom with any other may be completed by the
writing off and balancing of claims in bankers’ books.
This natural evolution, be it observed, has reached with
us a higher phase than has been reached where the
positively-regulative control of the State is more decided.
They have no clearing-house in France; and in France
the method of making payments by checks, so dominant
among ourselves, is very little employed and in an imperfect
way. I do not mean to imply that in England the
State has been a mere spectator of this development.
Unfortunately, it has from the beginning had relations
with banks and bankers: not much, however, to their
advantage, or that of the public. The first kind of deposit-bank
was in some sense a State-bank: merchants left funds
for security at the Mint in the Tower. But when Charles
I. appropriated their property without consent, and gave
it back to them only under pressure, after a long delay,
he destroyed their confidence. Similarly, when Charles
II., in furtherance of State-business, came to have habitual
transactions with the richer of the private bankers; and
when, having got nearly a million and a half of their
money in the Exchequer, he stole it, ruined a multitude
of merchants, distressed ten thousand depositors, and
made some lunatics and suicides, he gave a considerable
shock to the banking system as it then existed. Though
the results of State-relations with banks in later times
have not been so disastrous in this direct way, yet they
have been indirectly disastrous—perhaps even in a greater
degree. In return for a loan, the State gave the Bank of
England special privileges; and for the increase and continuance
of this loan the bribe was the maintenance of
these privileges—privileges which immensely hindered the
development of banks. The State did worse. It led the
Bank of England to the verge of bankruptcy by a forced
issue of notes, and then authorized it to
break its promises <span class="xxpn" id="p427">{427}</span>
to pay. Nay, worse still, it prevented the Bank of
England from fulfilling its promises to pay when it wished
to fulfil them. The evils that have arisen from the
positively-regulative action of the State on banks are too
multitudinous to be here enumerated. They may be
found in the writings of Tooke, Newmarch, Fullarton,
Macleod, Wilson, J. S. Mill, and others. All we have
here to note is, that while the enterprise of citizens in the
pursuit of private ends has developed this great trading-process,
which so immensely facilitates all other trading-processes,
Governments have over and over again disturbed
it to an almost fatal extent; and that, while they have
done enormous mischief of one kind by their positively-regulative
action, they have done enormous mischief of
another kind by failing in their negatively-regulative
action. They have not done the one thing they had to do:
they have not uniformly insisted on fulfilment of contract
between the banker and the customer who takes his
promise to pay on demand.</p>

<p>Between these two cases of the trade in food and the
trade in money, might be put the cases of other trades:
all of them carried on by organizations similarly evolved,
and similarly more or less deranged from time to time by
State-meddling. Passing over these, however, let us turn
from the positive method of elucidation to the comparative
method. When it is questioned whether the spontaneous
coöperation of men in pursuit of personal benefits will adequately
work out the general good, we may get guidance for
judgment by comparing the results achieved in countries
where spontaneous coöperation has been most active and
least regulated, with the results achieved in countries
where spontaneous coöperation has been less trusted and
State-action more trusted. Two cases, furnished by the
two leading nations on the Continent, will suffice.</p>

<p>In France, the École des Ponts et Chaussées was founded
in 1747 for educating civil engineers; and
in 1795 was <span class="xxpn" id="p428">{428}</span>
founded the École Polytechnique, serving, among other
purposes, to give a general scientific training to those
who were afterward to be more specially trained for civil
engineering. Averaging the two dates, we may say that for
a century France has had a State-established and State-maintained
appliance for producing skilled men of this
class—a double gland, we may call it, to secrete engineering
faculty for public use. In England, until quite recently,
we have had no institution for preparing civil engineers.
Not by intention, but unconsciously, we left the furnishing
of engineering faculty to take place under the law of
supply and demand—a law which at present seems to be
no more recognized as applying to education, than it was
recognized as applying to commerce in the days of bounties
and restrictions. This, however, by the way. We have
here simply to note that Brindley, Smeaton, Rennie,
Telford, and the rest, down to George Stephenson,
acquired their knowledge, and got their experience,
without State-aid or supervision. What have been the
comparative results in the two nations? Space does not
allow a detailed comparison: the later results must suffice.
Railways originated in England, not in France. Railways
spread through England faster than through France.
Many railways in France were laid out and officered by
English engineers. The earlier French railways were
made by English contractors; and English locomotives
served the French makers as models. The first French
work written on locomotive engines, published about 1840
(at least I had a copy at that date), was by the Comte de
Pambour, who had studied in England, and who gave in
his work nothing whatever but drawings and descriptions
of the engines of English makers.</p>

<p>The second illustration is supplied to us by the model
nation, now so commonly held up to us for imitation. Let
us contrast London and Berlin in respect of an all-essential
appliance for the comfort and health
of citizens. When, <span class="xxpn" id="p429">{429}</span>
at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the springs
and local conduits, supplemented by water-carriers, failed
to supply the Londoners; and when the water-famine, for
a long time borne, had failed to make the Corporation do
more than propose schemes, and had not spurred the central
government to do any thing; Hugh Myddleton, a merchant
citizen, took in hand himself the work of bringing the
New River to Islington. When he had half completed the
work, the king came to his help—not, indeed, in his
capacity of ruler, but in the capacity of speculator, investing
his money with a view to profit: his share being
disposed of by his successor after the formation of the New
River Company, which finished the distributing system.
Subsequently, the formation of other water-companies,
utilizing other sources, has given London a water-supply
that has grown with its growth. What, meanwhile,
happened at Berlin? Did there in 1613, when Hugh
Myddleton completed his work, grow up there a like
efficient system? Not at all. The seventeenth century
passed, the eighteenth century passed, the middle of the
nineteenth century was reached, and still Berlin had no
water-supply like that of London. What happened then?
Did the paternal government at length do what had been
so long left undone? No. Did the citizens at length
unite to secure the desideratum? No. It was finally
achieved by the citizens of another nation, more accustomed
to coöperate in gaining their own profits by ministering
to public needs. In 1845 an English company was formed
for giving Berlin an adequate water-supply; and the
work was executed by English contractors—Messrs. Fox
and Crampton.</p>

<p>Should it be said that great works of ancient nations, in
the shape of aqueducts, roads, etc., might be instanced in
proof that State agency secures such ends, or should it be
said that a comparison between the early growth of inland
navigation on the Continent, and its
later growth here, <span class="xxpn" id="p430">{430}</span>
would be to our disadvantage, I reply that, little as they
at first seem so, these facts are congruous with the general
doctrine. While the militant social type is dominant, and
the industrial organization but little developed, there is
but one coördinating agency for regulating both sets of
activities; just as we saw happens with the lower types
of individual organisms. It is only when a considerable
advance has been made in that metamorphosis which
develops the industrial structures at the expense of the
militant structures, and which brings along with it a
substantially-independent coördinating agency for the
industrial structures—it is only then that the efficiency of
these spontaneous coöperations for all purposes of internal
social life becomes greater than the efficiency of the central
governing agency.</p>

<p>Possibly it will be said that though, for subserving
material needs, the actions of individuals, stimulated by
necessity and made quick by competition, are demonstrably
adequate, they are not adequate for subserving other
needs. I do not see, however, that the facts justify this
position. We have but to glance around to find in abundance
similarly-generated appliances for satisfying our
higher desires, as well as our lower desires. The fact that
the Fine Arts have not thriven here as much as in some
Continental countries, is ascribable to natural character, to
absorption of our energies in other activities, and to the
repressive influence of chronic asceticism, rather than to
the absence of fostering agencies: these the interests of
individuals have provided in abundance. Literature, in
which we are second to none, owes, with us, nothing to
State-aid. The poetry which will live is poetry which has
been written without official prompting; and though we
have habitually had a prize-poet, paid to write loyal verses,
it may be said, without disparaging the present one, that
a glance over the entire list does not show any benefit
derived by poetry from State-patronage.
Nor are other <span class="xxpn" id="p431">{431}</span>
forms of literature any more indebted to State-patronage.
It was because there was a public liking for fiction that
fiction began to be produced; and the continued public
liking causes a continued production, including, along
with much that is worthless, much that could not have
been made better by any academic or other supervision.
And the like holds of biographies, histories, scientific
books, etc. Or, as a still more striking case of an agency
that has grown up to meet a non-material want, take the
newspaper press. What has been the genesis of this
marvellous appliance, which each day gives us an abstract
of the world’s life the day before? Under what promptings
have there been got together its staffs of editors, sub-editors,
article-writers, reviewers; its reporters of parliamentary
debates, of public meetings, of law cases and police cases;
its critics of music, theatricals, paintings, etc.; its correspondents
in all parts of the world? Who devised and
brought to perfection this system which at six o’clock in
the morning gives the people of Edinburgh a report of the
debates that ended at two or three o’clock in the House of
Commons, and at the same time tells them of events that
occurred the day before in America? It is not a Government
invention. It is not a Government suggestion. It
has not been in anyway improved or developed by legislation.
On the contrary, it has grown up in spite of many hinderances
from the Government and burdens which the Government
has imposed on it. For a long time the reporting of
parliamentary debates was resisted; for generations censorships
and prosecutions kept newspapers down, and for
several subsequent generations the laws in force negatived
a cheap press, and the educational benefits ac­com­pa­ny­ing
it. From the war-correspondent, whose letters give to the
very nations that are fighting their only trustworthy
accounts of what is being done, down to the newsboy who
brings round the third edition with the latest telegrams,
the whole organization is a
product of spontaneous <span class="xxpn" id="p432">{432}</span>
coöperation among private individuals, aiming to benefit
themselves by ministering to the intellectual needs of their
fellows—aiming also, not a few of them, to benefit their
fellows by giving them clearer ideas and a higher standard
of right. Nay, more than this is true. While the press is
not indebted to the Government, the Government is enormously
indebted to the press; without which, indeed, it
would stumble daily in the performance of its functions.
This agency which the State once did its best to put down,
and has all along impeded, now gives to the ministers news
in anticipation of their dispatches, gives to members of
Parliament a guiding knowledge of public opinion, enables
them to speak from the House of Commons benches to their
constituents, and gives to both legislative chambers a full
record of their proceedings.</p>

<p>I do not see, therefore, how there can be any doubt
respecting the sufficiency of agencies thus originating.
The truth that in this condition of mutual dependence
brought about by social life, there inevitably grow up arrangements
such that each secures his own ends by
ministering to the ends of others, seems to have been for a
long time one of those open secrets which remain secret
because they are so open; and even now the conspicuousness
of this truth seems to cause an imperfect consciousness
of its full meaning. The evidence shows, however, that
even were there no other form of spontaneous coöperation
among men than that dictated by self-interest, it might be
rationally held that this, under the negatively-regulative
control of a central power, would work out, in proper
order, the appliances for satisfying all needs, and carrying
on healthfully all the essential social functions.</p>

<p>But there is a further kind of spontaneous coöperation,
arising, like the other, independently of State-action, which
takes a large share in satisfying certain classes of needs.
Familiar though it is, this kind of spontaneous coöperation
is habitually ignored in sociological
discussions. Alike <span class="xxpn" id="p433">{433}</span>
from newspaper articles and parliamentary debates, it
might be inferred that, beyond the force due to men’s
selfish activities, there is no other social force than the
governmental force. There seems to be a deliberate omission
of the fact that, in addition to their selfish interests,
men have sympathetic interests, which, acting individually
and coöperatively, work out results scarcely less remarkable
than those which the selfish interests work out. It is true
that, during the earlier phases of social evolution, while yet
the type is mainly militant, agencies thus produced do not
exist: among the Spartans, I suppose, there were few, if
any, philanthropic agencies. But as there arise forms of
society leading toward the pacific type—forms in which the
industrial organization develops itself, and men’s activities
become of a kind that do not perpetually sear their sympathies;
these structures which their sympathies generate
become many and important. To the egoistic interests,
and the coöperations prompted by them, there come to be
added the altruistic interests and their coöperations; and
what the one set fails to do, the other does. That, in his
presentation of the doctrine he opposes, Prof. Huxley did
not set down the effects of fellow-feeling as supplementing
the effects of self-regarding feelings, surprises me the more,
because he displays fellow-feeling himself in so marked a
degree, and shows in his career how potent a social agency
it becomes. Let us glance rapidly over the results wrought
out among ourselves by individual and combined “altruism”—to
employ M. Comte’s useful word.</p>

<p>Though they show a trace of this feeling, I will not
dwell upon the numerous institutions by which men are
enabled to average the chances throughout life by insurance
societies, which provide against the evils entailed by
premature deaths, accidents, fires, wrecks, etc.; for these
are mainly mercantile and egoistic in their origin. Nor
will I do more than name those multitudinous Friendly
Societies that have arisen
spontaneously among the <span class="xxpn" id="p434">{434}</span>
working-classes to give mutual aid in time of sickness, and
which the Commission now sitting is showing to be
immensely beneficial, notwithstanding their defects; for
these also, though containing a larger element of sympathy,
are prompted chiefly by anticipations of personal benefits.
Leaving these, let us turn to the organizations in which
altruism is more decided: taking first that by which
religious ministrations are carried on. Throughout Scotland
and England, cut away all that part of it which is
not established by law—in Scotland, the Episcopal Church,
the Free Church, the United Presbyterians, and other
Dissenting bodies; in England, the Wesleyans, Independents,
and the various minor sects. Cut off, too, from
the Established Church itself, all that part added in
recent times by voluntary zeal, made conspicuous enough
by the new steeples that have been rising on all sides; and
then also take out, from the remainder of the Established
Church, that energy which has during these three generations
been infused into it by competition with the
Dissenters: so reducing it to the degraded, inert state
in which John Wesley found it. Do this, and it becomes
manifest that more than half the organisation, and immensely
more than half its function, is extra-governmental.
Look round, again, at the multitudinous institutions for
mitigating men’s ills—the hospitals, dispensaries, alms-houses,
and the like—the various benevolent and mendicity
societies, etc., of which London alone contains between
six and seven hundred. From our vast St. Thomas’s,
exceeding the palace of the Legislature itself in bulk,
down to Dorcas societies and village clothing-clubs, we
have charitable agencies, many in kind and countless in
number, which supplement, perhaps too largely, the legally-established
one; and which, whatever evil they may have
done along with the good, have done far less evil than the
Poor-Law organization did before it was reformed in 1834.
Akin to these are still more striking examples
of power in <span class="xxpn" id="p435">{435}</span>
agencies thus originating, such as that furnished by the
Anti-slavery Society, which carried the emancipation of
the slaves, notwithstanding the class-opposition so predominant
in the Legislature. And if we look for more
recent like instances, we have them in the organization
which promptly and efficiently dealt with the cotton-famine
in Lancashire, and in that which last year ministered to
the wounded and distressed in France. Once more,
consider our educational system as it existed till within
these few years. Such part of it as did not consist of
private schools, carried on for personal profit, consisted of
schools or colleges set up or maintained by men for the
benefit of their fellows, and the posterity of their fellows.
Omitting the few founded or partially founded by kings,
the numerous endowed schools scattered throughout the
kingdom, originated from altruistic feelings (so far, at least,
as they were not due to egoistic desires for good places in
the other world). And then, after these appliances for
teaching the poor had been almost entirely appropriated by
the rich, whence came the remedy? Another altruistic
organization grew up for educating the poor, struggled
against the opposition of the Church and the governing
classes, eventually forced these to enter into competition
and produce like altruistic organizations, until by school
systems, local and general, ecclesiastical, dissenting, and
secular, the mass of the people had been brought from a
state of almost entire ignorance to one in which nearly all
of them possessed the rudiments of knowledge. But for
these spontaneously-developed agencies, ignorance would
have been universal. Not only such knowledge as the
poor now possess—not only the knowledge of the trading-classes—not
only the knowledge of those who write books
and leading articles; but the knowledge of those who carry
on the business of the country as ministers and legislators,
has been derived from these extra-governmental agencies,
egoistic or altruistic. Yet now,
strangely enough, the <span class="xxpn" id="p436">{436}</span>
cultured intelligence of the country has taken to spurning
its parent; and that to which it owes both its existence and
the consciousness of its own value is pooh-poohed as though
it had done, and could do, nothing of importance! One
other fact let me add. While such teaching organizations,
and their results in the shape of enlightenment, are due to
these spontaneous agencies, to such agencies also are due
the great improvements in the quality of the culture now
happily beginning to take place. The spread of scientific
knowledge, and of the scientific spirit, has not been brought
about by laws and officials. Our scientific societies have
arisen from the spontaneous coöperation of those interested
in the accumulation and diffusion of the kinds of truth they
respectively deal with. Though the British Association
has from time to time obtained certain small subsidies,
their results in the way of advancing science have borne
but an extremely small ratio to the results achieved without
any such aid. If there needs a conclusive illustration of
the power of agencies thus arising, we have it in the history
and achievements of the Royal Institution. From this,
which is a product of altruistic coöperation, and which has
had for its successive professors Young, Davy, Faraday,
and Tyndall, there has come a series of brilliant discoveries
which cannot be paralleled by a series from any State-nurtured
institution.</p>

<p>I hold, then, that forced, as men in society are, to seek
satisfaction of their own wants by satisfying the wants of
others; and led as they also are by sentiments which social
life has fostered, to satisfy many wants of others irrespective
of their own; they are moved by two sets of forces which,
working together, will amply suffice to carry on all needful
activities; and I think the facts fully justify this belief.
It is true that, <i>a priori</i>, one would not have supposed that
by their unconscious coöperations men could have wrought
out such results, any more than one would have supposed,
<i>a priori</i>, that by their unconscious
coöperation they could <span class="xxpn" id="p437">{437}</span>
have evolved Language. But reasoning <i>a posteriori</i>, which
it is best to do when we have the facts before us, it becomes
manifest that they can do this; that they have done it in
very astonishing ways; and perhaps may do it hereafter
in ways still more astonishing. Scarcely any scientific
generalization has, I think, a broader inductive basis than
we have for the belief that these egoistic and altruistic
feelings are powers which, taken together, amply suffice
to originate and carry on all the activities which constitute
healthy national life: the only pre-requisite being,
that they shall be under the negatively-regulative control
of a central power—that the entire aggregate of individuals,
acting through the legislature and executive as
its agents, shall put upon each individual, and group
of individuals, the restraints needful to prevent aggression,
direct and indirect.</p>

<p>And here I might go on to supplement the argument by
showing that the immense majority of the evils which
government aid is invoked to remedy, are evils which arise
immediately or remotely because it does not perform
properly its negatively-regulative function. From the
waste of, probably, £100,000,000 of national capital in unproductive
railways, for which the Legislature is responsible
by permitting the original proprietary contracts to be
broken,<a class="afnanch" href="#fn41" id="fnanch41">41</a>
down to the railway accidents and loss of life
caused by unpunctuality, which would never have grown
to its present height were there an easy remedy for breach
of contract between company and passenger; nearly all the
vices of railway management have arisen from the non-ad­min­i­stra­tion
of justice. And everywhere else we shall
find that, were the restraining action of the State prompt,
effective, and costless to those aggrieved, the pleas put in
for positive regulation would nearly all disappear.</p>

and Railway Policy.”</p></div>

<p class="padtopb">I am thus brought naturally to remark on
the title given <span class="xxpn" id="p438">{438}</span>
to this theory of State-functions. That “Administrative
Nihilism” adequately describes the view set forth by Von
Humboldt, may be: I have not read his work. But I cannot
see how it adequately describes the doctrine I have
been defending; nor do I see how this can be properly
expressed by the more positive title, “police-government.”
The conception suggested by police-government does not
include the conception of an organization for external
protection. So long as each nation is given to burglary, I
quite admit each other nation must keep guards, under the
forms of army or navy, or both, to prevent burglars from
breaking in. And the title police-government does not, in
its ordinary acceptation, comprehend these offensive and
defensive appliances needful for dealing with foreign
enemies. At the other extreme, too, it falls short of the
full meaning to be expressed. While it duly conveys the
idea of an organization required for checking and punishing
criminal aggression, it does not convey any idea of the no
less important organization required for dealing with civil
aggression—an organization quite essential for properly
discharging the negatively-regulative function. Though
latent police-force may be considered as giving their
efficiency to legal decisions on all questions brought into
<i>nisi prius</i> courts, yet, since here police-force rarely comes
into visible play, police-government does not suggest this
very extensive part of the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice. Far
from contending for a <i>laissez-faire</i> policy in the sense which
the phrase commonly suggests, I have contended for a more
active control of the kind distinguishable as negatively
regulative. One of the reasons I have urged for excluding
State-action from other spheres, is, that it may become
more efficient within its proper sphere. And I have argued
that the wretched performance of its duties within its
proper sphere continues, because its time is chiefly spent
over imaginary duties.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn42" id="fnanch42">42</a>
The facts that
often, in bankruptcy <span class="xxpn" id="p439">{439}</span>
cases, three-fourths and more of the assets go in costs;
that creditors are led by the expectation of great delay and
a miserable dividend to accept almost any composition
offered; and that so the bankruptcy-law offers a premium
to roguery; are facts which would long since have ceased
to be facts, had citizens been mainly occupied in getting an
efficient judicial system. If the due performance by the
State of its all-essential function had been the question on
which elections were fought, we should not see, as we now
do, that a shivering cottager who steals palings for
firewood, or a hungry tramp who robs an orchard, gets
punishment in more than the old Hebrew measure, while
great financial frauds which ruin their thousands bring no
punishments. Were the negatively-regulative function of
the State in internal affairs dominant in the thoughts of
men, within the Legislature and without, there would be
tolerated no such treatment as that suffered lately by
Messrs. Walker, of Cornhill; who, having been robbed of
£6,000 worth of property and having spent £950 in rewards
for apprehending thieves and prosecuting them, cannot get
back the proceeds of their property found on the thieves—who
bear the costs of administering justice, while the
Corporation of London makes £940 profit out of their loss.
It is in large measure because I hold that these crying
abuses and inefficiencies, which everywhere characterize
the ad­min­i­stra­tion of justice, need more than any other
evils to be remedied; and because I hold that remedy of
them can go on only as fast as the internal function of the
State is more and more restricted to the ad­min­i­stra­tion of
justice; that I take the view which I have been re-explaining.
<i>It is a law illustrated by organizations of every kind, that,
in proportion as there is to be efficiency, there must be
specialization, both of structure and func­tion—spe­cial­i­za­tion
which, of ne­ces­sity, im­plies ac­com­pa­ny­ing lim­i­ta­tion.</i> And,
as I have elsewhere argued, the development of rep­re­sen­ta­tive
government is the development of
a type of <span class="xxpn" id="p440">{440}</span>
government fitted above all others for this negatively-regulative
control, and, above all others, ill fitted for positively-regulative
control.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn43" id="fnanch43">43</a>
This doctrine, that while the
negatively-regulative control should be extended and
made better, the positively-regulative control should be
diminished, and that the one change implies the other,
may properly be called the doctrine of Specialized Ad­min­i­stra­tion—if
it is to be named from its administrative
aspect. I regret that my presentation of this doctrine has
been such as to lead to mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tion. Either it is that
I have not adequately explained it, which, if true, surprises
me, or else it is that the space occupied in seeking to show
what are not the duties of the State is so much greater
than the space occupied in defining its duties, that these
last make but little impression. In any case, that Prof.
Huxley should have construed my view in the way he has
done, shows me that it needs fuller exposition; since, had
he put upon it the construction I intended, he would not, I
think, have included it under the title he has used, nor
would he have seen it needful to raise the question I have
endeavoured to answer.</p>

<p class="padtopb"><span class="smcap">P<b>OSTSCRIPT</b>.</span>—Since the above article was written, a fact
of some significance in relation to the question of State-management
has come under my notice. There is one
department, at any rate, in which the State succeeds well—the
Post-Office. And this department is sometimes
instanced as showing the superiority of public over
private ad­min­i­stra­tion.</p>

<p>I am not about to call in question the general satisfactoriness
of our postal arrangements; nor shall I contend
that this branch of State-organization, now well-established,
could be replaced with advantage. Possibly the type of
our social structure has become, in this respect, so far
fixed that a radical change would be
injurious. In dealing <span class="xxpn" id="p441">{441}</span>
with those who make much of this success, I have contented
myself with showing that the developments which have
made the Post-Office efficient, have not originated with the
Government, but have been thrust upon it from without.
I have in evidence cited the facts that the mail-coach
system was established by a private individual, Mr. Palmer,
and lived down official opposition; that the reform originated
by Mr. Rowland Hill had to be made against the wills of
<i>employés</i>; and, further, I have pointed out that, even as it
is, a large part of the work is done by private enterprise—that
the Government gets railway-companies to do for it
most of the inland carriage, and steam-boat companies the
outland carriage: contenting itself with doing the local
collection and distribution.</p>

<p>Respecting the general question whether, in the absence
of our existing postal system, private enterprise would
have developed one as good or better, I have been able
to say only that analogies like that furnished by our
newspaper-system, with its efficient news-vending organization,
warrant us in believing that it would. Recently,
however, I have been shown both that private enterprise
is capable of this, and that, but for a legal interdict, it
would have done long ago what the State has but lately
done. Here is the proof:―</p>

<blockquote class="blktight">

<p>“To facilitate correspondence between one part of London and another
was not originally one of the objects of the Post-Office. But, in the reign of
Charles II., an enterprising citizen of London, William Dockwray, set up,
at great expense, a penny post, which delivered letters and parcels six or
eight times a-day in the busy and crowded streets near the Exchange, and
four times a-day in the outskirts of the capital. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As soon as it became
clear that the speculation would be lucrative, the Duke of York complained
of it as an infraction of his monopoly, and the courts of law decided in his
favour.”—<i>Macaulay</i>, <i>History of England</i>, 1866, i., 302–3.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus it appears that two centuries since, private enterprise
initiated a local postal system, similar, in respect
both of cheapness and frequency of distribution, to that
lately-established one boasted of as a State-success. Judging
by what has happened in other
cases with private <span class="xxpn" id="p442">{442}</span>
enterprises which had small beginnings, we may infer that the
system thus commenced, would have developed throughout
the kingdom as fast as the needs pressed and the possibilities
allowed. So far from being indebted to the State, we
have reason to believe that, but for State-repression, we
should have obtained a postal organization like our present
one generations ago!</p>

<p class="padtopb"><span class="smcap">S<b>ECOND</b>
P<b>OSTSCRIPT.</b></span>—When the foregoing essay was
republished in the third series of my <i>Essays, Scientific,
Political, and Speculative</i>, I included, in the preface to
the volume, some comments upon Prof. Huxley’s reply.
In the absence of this preface, now no longer appropriate,
there seems no other fit place for these comments than
this. I therefore here append them.</p>

<p>“On the brief rejoinder to my arguments which Prof.
Huxley makes in the preface to his <i>Critiques and Addresses</i>,
I may here say a few words. The reasons he gives for
still thinking that the name ‘Administrative Nihilism’
fitly indicates the system which I have described as
‘negatively regulative,’ are, I think, adequately met by
asking whether ‘Ethical Nihilism’ would fitly describe
the remnant of the decalogue, were all its positive injunctions
omitted. If the eight commandments which,
substantially or literally, come under the form ‘thou shalt
not,’ constitute by themselves a set of rules which can
scarcely be called nihilistic; I do not see how an administrative
system limited to the enforcement of such rules can
be called nihilistic: especially if to the punishment of
murder, adultery, stealing, and false-witness, it adds the
punishment of assault, breach of contract, and all minor
aggressions, down to the annoyance of neighbours by
nuisances. Respecting the second and essential question,
whether limitation of the internal functions of government
to those which are negatively regulative, is consistent with
that theory of the social organism
and its controlling <span class="xxpn" id="p443">{443}</span>
agencies held by me, I may say that the insufficiency of
my reply has not, I think, been shown. I was tacitly
asked how the analogy I have drawn between those
governmental structures by which the parts of the body
politic have their actions regulated and those nervous
structures which regulate the organic actions of the individual
living body, is to be reconciled with my belief that
social activities will in the main adjust themselves. My
answer was this. I recognized as essential the positively-regulative
functions of the State in respect to the
offensive and defensive appliances needful for national
self-preservation, during the predatory phase of social
evolution; and I not only admitted the importance of its
negatively-regulative functions in respect to the internal
social activities, but insisted that these should be carried
out much more efficiently than now. Assuming always,
however, that the internal social activities continue subject
to that restraining action of the State which consists in
preventing aggressions, direct and indirect, I contended
that the coördination of these internal social activities
is effected by other structures of a different kind. I
aimed to show that my two beliefs are not inconsistent, by
pointing out that in the individual organism, also, those
vital activities which parallel the activities constituting
national life, are regulated by a substantially-independent
nervous system. Prof. Huxley does, indeed, remind me
that recent researches show increasingly the influence of
the cerebro-spinal nervous system over the processes of
organic life; against which, however, has to be set the
growing evidence of the power exercised by the visceral
nervous system over the cerebro-spinal. But, recognizing
the influence he names (which, indeed, corresponds to that
governmental influence I regard as necessary); I think
the consistency of my positions is maintainable so long
as it is manifest that the viscera, under the
control of their <span class="xxpn" id="p444">{444}</span>
own nervous system, can carry on the vital actions when
the control of the cerebro-spinal system is substantially
arrested by sleep, or by anæsthetics, or by other causes of
insensibility; and while it is shown that a considerable
degree of coördination may exist among the organs of a
creature which has no nervous
system at all.”</p>

<p>Of the many ways in which common-sense inferences
about social affairs are flatly contradicted by events (as
when measures taken to suppress a book cause increased
circulation of it, or as when attempts to prevent usurious
rates of interest make the terms harder for the borrower,
or as when there is greater difficulty in getting things at
the places of production than elsewhere) one of the most
curious is the way in which the more things improve the
louder become the exclamations about their badness.</p>

<p>In days when the people were without any political
power, their subjection was rarely complained of; but
after free institutions had so far advanced in England that
our political arrangements were envied by continental
peoples, the denunciations of aristocratic rule grew gradually
stronger, until there came a great widening of the
franchise, soon followed by complaints that things were
going wrong for want of still further widening. If we trace
up the treatment of women from the days of savagedom,
when they bore all the burdens and after the men had
eaten received such food as remained, up through the
middle ages when they served the men at
their meals, to <span class="xxpn" id="p446">{446}</span>
our own day when throughout our social arrangements the
claims of women are always put first, we see that along
with the worst treatment there went the least apparent
consciousness that the treatment was bad; while now that
they are better treated than ever before, the proclaiming
of their grievances daily strengthens: the loudest outcries
coming from “the paradise of women,” America. A
century ago, when scarcely a man could be found who was
not occasionally intoxicated, and when inability to take one
or two bottles of wine brought contempt, no agitation arose
against the vice of drunkenness; but now that, in the course
of fifty years, the voluntary efforts of temperance societies,
joined with more general causes, have produced comparative
sobriety, there are vociferous demands for laws to prevent
the ruinous effects of the liquor traffic. Similarly again
with education. A few generations back, ability to read
and write was practically limited to the upper and middle
classes, and the suggestion that the rudiments of culture
should be given to labourers was never made, or, if made,
ridiculed; but when, in the days of our grandfathers, the
Sunday-school system, initiated by a few philanthropists,
began to spread and was followed by the establishment of
day-schools, with the result that among the masses those
who could read and write were no longer the exceptions,
and the demand for cheap literature rapidly increased,
there began the cry that the people were perishing for lack
of knowledge, and that the State must not simply educate
them but must force education upon them.</p>

<p>And so is it, too, with the general state of the population in
respect of food, clothing, shelter, and the appliances of life.
Leaving out of the comparison early barbaric states, there
has been a conspicuous progress from the time when most
rustics lived on barley bread, rye bread, and oatmeal, down
to our own time when the consumption of white wheaten
bread is universal—from the days when coarse jackets
reaching to the knees left the legs bare, down
to the present <span class="xxpn" id="p447">{447}</span>
day when labouring people, like their employers, have the
whole body covered, by two or more layers of clothing—from
the old era of single-roomed huts without chimneys,
or from the 15th century when even an ordinary gentleman’s
house was commonly without wainscot or plaster on
its walls, down to the present century when every cottage
has more rooms than one and the houses of artizans
usually have several, while all have fire-places, chimneys,
and glazed windows, accompanied mostly by paper-hangings
and painted doors; there has been, I say, a conspicuous
progress in the condition of the people. And this progress
has been still more marked within our own time. Any one
who can look back 60 years, when the amount of pauperism
was far greater than now and beggars abundant, is struck
by the comparative size and finish of the new houses
occupied by operatives—by the better dress of workmen,
who wear broad-cloth on Sundays, and that of servant girls,
who vie with their mistresses—by the higher standard
of living which leads to a great demand for the best
qualities of food by working people: all results of the double
change to higher wages and cheaper commodities, and a distribution
of taxes which has relieved the lower classes at
the expense of the upper classes. He is struck, too, by the
contrast between the small space which popular welfare then
occupied in public attention, and the large space it now
occupies, with the result that outside and inside Parliament,
plans to benefit the millions form the leading topics, and
everyone having means is expected to join in some philanthropic
effort. Yet while elevation, mental and physical, of
the masses is going on far more rapidly than ever before—while
the lowering of the death-rate proves that the average
life is less trying, there swells louder and louder the
cry that the evils are so great that nothing short of a social
revolution can cure them. In presence of obvious improvements,
joined with that increase of longevity which even
alone yields conclusive proof of general
amelioration, it is <span class="xxpn" id="p448">{448}</span>
proclaimed, with increasing vehemence, that things are so
bad that society must be pulled to pieces and re-organized
on another plan. In this case, then, as in the previous
cases instanced, in proportion as the evil decreases the
denunciation of it increases; and as fast as natural causes
are shown to be powerful there grows up the belief that
they are powerless.</p>

<p>Not that the evils to be remedied are small. Let no one
suppose that, by emphasizing the above paradox, I wish to
make light of the sufferings which most men have to bear.
The fates of the great majority have ever been, and doubtless
still are, so sad that it is painful to think of them.
Unquestionably the existing type of social organization is
one which none who care for their kind can contemplate
with satisfaction; and unquestionably men’s activities
ac­com­pa­ny­ing this type are far from being admirable.
The strong divisions of rank and the immense inequalities
of means, are at variance with that ideal of human relations
on which the sympathetic imagination likes to dwell; and
the average conduct, under the pressure and excitement
of social life as at present carried on, is in sundry respects
repulsive. Though the many who revile competition
strangely ignore the enormous benefits resulting from it—though
they forget that most of the appliances and products
distinguishing civilization from savagery, and making
possible the maintenance of a large population on a small
area, have been developed by the struggle for existence—though
they disregard the fact that while every man, as
producer, suffers from the under-bidding of competitors, yet,
as consumer, he is immensely advantaged by the cheapening
of all he has to buy—though they persist in dwelling on
the evils of competition and saying nothing of its benefits;
yet it is not to be denied that the evils are great, and form
a large set-off from the benefits. The system under which
we at present live fosters dishonesty and lying. It prompts
adulterations of countless kinds; it is
answerable for the <span class="xxpn" id="p449">{449}</span>
cheap imitations which eventually in many cases thrust
the genuine articles out of the market; it leads to the use
of short weights and false measures; it introduces bribery,
which vitiates most trading relations, from those of the
manufacturer and buyer down to those of the shopkeeper
and servant; it encourages deception to such an extent
that an assistant who cannot tell a falsehood with a good
face is blamed; and often it gives the conscientious trader
the choice between adopting the malpractices of his competitors,
or greatly injuring his creditors by bankruptcy.
Moreover, the extensive frauds, common throughout the
commercial world and daily exposed in law-courts and
newspapers, are largely due to the pressure under which
competition places the higher industrial classes; and are
otherwise due to that lavish expenditure which, as implying
success in the commercial struggle, brings honour.
With these minor evils must be joined the major one, that
the distribution achieved by the system, gives to those who
regulate and superintend, a share of the total produce
which bears too large a ratio to the share it gives to the
actual workers. Let it not be thought, then, that in saying
what I have said above, I under-estimate those vices of our
competitive system which, 30 years ago, I described and
denounced.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn44" id="fnanch44">44</a>
But it is not a question of absolute evils; it
is a question of relative evils—whether the evils at present
suffered are or are not less than the evils which would
be suffered under another system—whether efforts for
mitigation along the lines thus far followed are not more
likely to succeed than efforts along utterly different lines.</p>

<p>This is the question here to be considered. I must be
excused for first of all setting forth sundry truths which
are, to some at any rate, tolerably familiar, before proceeding
to draw inferences which are not so familiar.</p>

Morals of Trade.”</p></div>

<p class="padtopb">Speaking broadly, every man works
that he may avoid <span class="xxpn" id="p450">{450}</span>
suffering. Here, remembrance of the pangs of hunger
prompts him; and there, he is prompted by the sight of the
slave-driver’s lash. His immediate dread may be the
punishment which physical circumstances will inflict, or
may be punishment inflicted by human agency. He must
have a master; but the master may be Nature or may be a
fellow man. When he is under the impersonal coercion of
Nature, we say that he is free; and when he is under the
personal coercion of some one above him, we call him,
according to the degree of his dependence, a slave, a serf,
or a vassal. Of course I omit the small minority who
inherit means: an incidental, and not a necessary, social
element. I speak only of the vast majority, both cultured
and uncultured, who maintain themselves by labour, bodily
or mental, and must either exert themselves of their own
unconstrained wills, prompted only by thoughts of naturally-resulting
evils or benefits, or must exert themselves with
constrained wills, prompted by thoughts of evils and benefits
artificially resulting.</p>

<p>Men may work together in a society under either of
these two forms of control: forms which, though in many
cases mingled, are essentially contrasted. Using the word
coöperation in its wide sense, and not in that restricted
sense now commonly given to it, we may say that social
life must be carried on by either voluntary coöperation or
compulsory coöperation; or, to use Sir Henry Maine’s
words, the system must be that of <i>contract</i> or that of <i>status</i>—that
in which the individual is left to do the best he can
by his spontaneous efforts and get success or failure
according to his efficiency, and that in which he has his
appointed place, works under coercive rule, and has his
apportioned share of food, clothing, and shelter.</p>

<p>The system of voluntary coöperation is that by which,
in civilized societies, industry is now everywhere carried
on. Under a simple form we have it on every farm, where
the labourers, paid by the farmer himself
and taking orders <span class="xxpn" id="p451">{451}</span>
directly from him, are free to stay or go as they please.
And of its more complex form an example is yielded by
every manufacturing concern, in which, under partners,
come managers and clerks, and under these, time-keepers
and over-lookers, and under these operatives of different
grades. In each of these cases there is an obvious working
together, or coöperation, of employer and employed, to
obtain in the one case a crop and in the other case a manufactured
stock. And then, at the same time, there is a far
more extensive, though unconscious, coöperation with
other workers of all grades throughout the society. For
while these particular employers and employed are severally
occupied with their special kinds of work, other employers
and employed are making other things needed for the
carrying on of their lives as well as the lives of all others.
This voluntary coöperation, from its simplest to its most
complex forms, has the common trait that those concerned
work together by consent. There is no one to force terms
or to force acceptance. It is perfectly true that in many
cases an employer may give, or an <i>employé</i> may accept,
with reluctance: circumstances he says compel him. But
what are the circumstances? In the one case there are
goods ordered, or a contract entered into, which he cannot
supply or execute without yielding; and in the other case he
submits to a wage less than he likes because otherwise he
will have no money wherewith to procure food and warmth.
The general formula is not—“Do this, or I will make
you;” but it is—“Do this, or leave your place and take
the consequences.”</p>

<p>On the other hand compulsory coöperation is exemplified
by an army—not so much by our own army, the service in
which is under agreement for a specified period, but in a
continental army, raised by conscription. Here, in time of
peace, the daily duties—cleaning, parade, drill, sentry
work, and the rest—and in time of war the various actions
of the camp and the battle-field, are
done under command, <span class="xxpn" id="p452">{452}</span>
without room for any exercise of choice. Up from the
private soldier through the non-commissioned officers and
the half-dozen or more grades of commissioned officers, the
universal law is absolute obedience from the grade below
to the grade above. The sphere of individual will is such
only as is allowed by the will of the superior. Breaches of
subordination are, according to their gravity, dealt with by
deprivation of leave, extra drill, imprisonment, flogging,
and, in the last resort, shooting. Instead of the understanding
that there must be obedience in respect of specified
duties under pain of dismissal; the understanding now is—“Obey
in everything ordered under penalty of inflicted
suffering and perhaps death.”</p>

<p>This form of coöperation, still exemplified in an army,
has in days gone by been the form of coöperation throughout
the civil population. Everywhere, and at all times,
chronic war generates a militant type of structure, not in
the body of soldiers only but throughout the community at
large. Practically, while the conflict between societies is
actively going on, and fighting is regarded as the only
manly occupation, the society is the quiescent army and
the army the mobilized society: that part which does not
take part in battle, composed of slaves, serfs, women,
&amp;c., constituting the commissariat. Naturally, therefore,
throughout the mass of inferior individuals constituting the
commissariat, there is maintained a system of discipline
identical in nature if less elaborate. The fighting body being,
under such conditions, the ruling body, and the rest of the
community being incapable of resistance, those who control
the fighting body will, of course, impose their control upon
the non-fighting body; and the <i>régime</i> of coercion will be
applied to it with such modifications only as the different
circumstances involve. Prisoners of war become slaves.
Those who were free cultivators before the conquest of
their country, become serfs attached to the soil. Petty
chiefs become subject to superior chiefs;
these smaller lords <span class="xxpn" id="p453">{453}</span>
become vassals to over-lords; and so on up to the highest:
the social ranks and powers being of like essential nature with
the ranks and powers throughout the military organization.
And while for the slaves compulsory coöperation is the
unqualified system, a coöperation which is in part
compulsory is the system that pervades all grades above.
Each man’s oath of fealty to his suzerain takes the form—“I
am your man.”</p>

<p>Throughout Europe, and especially in our own country,
this system of compulsory coöperation gradually relaxed in
rigour, while the system of voluntary coöperation step by
step replaced it. As fast as war ceased to be the business
of life, the social structure produced by war and appropriate
to it, slowly became qualified by the social structure
produced by industrial life and appropriate to it. In
proportion as a decreasing part of the community was
devoted to offensive and defensive activities, an increasing
part became devoted to production and distribution.
Growing more numerous, more powerful, and taking refuge
in towns where it was less under the power of the militant
class, this industrial population carried on its life under the
system of voluntary coöperation. Though municipal governments
and guild-regulations, partially pervaded by ideas
and usages derived from the militant type of society, were
in some degree coercive; yet production and distribution
were in the main carried on under agreement—alike
between buyers and sellers, and between masters and
workmen. As fast as these social relations and forms
of activity became dominant in urban populations, they
influenced the whole community: compulsory coöperation
lapsed more and more, through money commutation for
services, military and civil; while divisions of rank became
less rigid and class-power diminished. Until at length,
restraints exercised by incorporated trades having fallen
into desuetude, as well as the rule of rank over rank,
voluntary coöperation became
the universal principle. <span class="xxpn" id="p454">{454}</span>
Purchase and sale became the law for all kinds of services
as well as for all kinds of commodities.</p>

<p class="padtopb">The restlessness generated by pressure against the conditions
of existence, perpetually prompts the desire to try a
new position. Everyone knows how long-continued rest in
one attitude becomes wearisome—everyone has found how
even the best easy chair, at first rejoiced in, becomes after
many hours intolerable; and change to a hard seat, previously
occupied and rejected, seems for a time to be a great
relief. It is the same with incorporated humanity. Having
by long struggles emancipated itself from the hard discipline
of the ancient <i>régime</i>, and having discovered that the new
<i>régime</i> into which it has grown, though relatively easy, is not
without stresses and pains, its impatience with these prompts
the wish to try another system: which other system is, in
principle if not in appearance, the same as that which during
past generations was escaped from with much rejoicing.</p>

<p>For as fast as the <i>régime</i> of contract is discarded the
<i>régime</i> of status is of necessity adopted. As fast as
voluntary coöperation is abandoned compulsory coöperation
must be substituted. Some kind of organization labour
must have; and if it is not that which arises by agreement
under free competition, it must be that which is imposed by
authority. Unlike in appearance and names as it may be to
the old order of slaves and serfs, working under masters,
who were coerced by barons, who were themselves vassals
of dukes or kings, the new order wished for, constituted
by workers under foremen of small groups, overlooked by
superintendents, who are subject to higher local managers,
who are controlled by superiors of districts, themselves
under a central government, must be essentially the same
in principle. In the one case, as in the other, there must
be established grades, and enforced subordination of each
grade to the grades above. This is a truth which the
communist or the socialist does not
dwell upon. Angry <span class="xxpn" id="p455">{455}</span>
with the existing system under which each of us takes care
of himself, while all of us see that each has fair play, he
thinks how much better it would be for all of us to take
care of each of us; and he refrains from thinking of the
machinery by which this is to be done. Inevitably, if each
is to be cared for by all, then the embodied all must get the
means—the necessaries of life. What it gives to each must
be taken from the accumulated contributions; and it must
therefore require from each his proportion—must tell him
how much he has to give to the general stock in the shape
of production, that he may have so much in the shape of
sustentation. Hence, before he can be provided for, he must
put himself under orders, and obey those who say what
he shall do, and at what hours, and where; and who give
him his share of food, clothing, and shelter. If competition
is excluded, and with it buying and selling, there can be no
voluntary exchange of so much labour for so much produce;
but there must be apportionment of the one to the other by
appointed officers. This apportionment must be enforced.
Without alternative the work must be done, and without
alternative the benefit, whatever it may be, must be accepted.
For the worker may not leave his place at will and offer
himself elsewhere. Under such a system he cannot be
accepted elsewhere, save by order of the authorities. And
it is manifest that a standing order would forbid employment
in one place of an insubordinate member from another place:
the system could not be worked if the workers were severally
allowed to go or come as they pleased. With corporals and
sergeants under them, the captains of industry must carry
out the orders of their colonels, and these of their generals,
up to the council of the commander-in-chief; and obedience
must be required throughout the industrial army as throughout
a fighting army. “Do your prescribed duties, and
take your apportioned rations,” must be the rule of the one
as of the other.</p>

<p>“Well, be it so;” replies the
socialist. “The workers <span class="xxpn" id="p456">{456}</span>
will appoint their own officers, and these will always be
subject to criticisms of the mass they regulate. Being thus
in fear of public opinion, they will be sure to act judiciously
and fairly; or when they do not, will be deposed by the
popular vote, local or general. Where will be the grievance
of being under superiors, when the superiors themselves
are under democratic control?” And in this attractive
vision the socialist has full belief.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Iron and brass are simpler things than flesh and blood,
and dead wood than living nerve; and a machine constructed
of the one works in more definite ways than an
organism constructed of the other,—especially when the
machine is worked by the inorganic forces of steam or
water, while the organism is worked by the forces of living
nerve-centres. Manifestly, then, the ways in which the
machine will work are much more readily calculable than
the ways in which the organism will work. Yet in how
few cases does the inventor foresee rightly the actions of
his new apparatus! Read the patent-list, and it will be found
that not more than one device in fifty turns out to be of any
service. Plausible as his scheme seemed to the inventor,
one or other hitch prevents the intended operation, and brings
out a widely different result from that which he wished.</p>

<p>What, then, shall we say of these schemes which have
to do not with dead matters and forces, but with complex
living organisms working in ways less readily foreseen,
and which involve the coöperation of multitudes of such
organisms? Even the units out of which this re-arranged
body politic is to be formed are often in­comp­re­hen­si­ble.
Everyone is from time to time surprised by others’ behaviour,
and even by the deeds of relatives who are best known to
him. Seeing, then, how uncertainly anyone can foresee the
actions of an individual, how can he with any certainty foresee
the operation of a social structure? He proceeds on the
assumption that all concerned will judge
rightly and act <span class="xxpn" id="p457">{457}</span>
fairly—will think as they ought to think, and act as they
ought to act; and he assumes this regardless of the daily
experiences which show him that men do neither the one
nor the other, and forgetting that the complaints he makes
against the existing system show his belief to be that men
have neither the wisdom nor the rectitude which his plan
requires them to have.</p>

<p>Paper constitutions raise smiles on the faces of those
who have observed their results; and paper social systems
similarly affect those who have contemplated the available
evidence. How little the men who wrought the French
revolution and were chiefly concerned in setting up the
new governmental apparatus, dreamt that one of the early
actions of this apparatus would be to behead them all!
How little the men who drew up the American Declaration
of Independence and framed the republic, anticipated that
after some generations the legislature would lapse into the
hands of wire-pullers; that its doings would turn upon the
contests of office-seekers; that political action would be
everywhere vitiated by the intrusion of a foreign element
holding the balance between parties; that electors, instead of
judging for themselves, would habitually be led to the polls
in thousands by their “bosses;” and that respectable men
would be driven out of public life by the insults and slanders
of professional politicians. Nor were there better previsions
in those who gave constitutions to the various other states of
the New World, in which unnumbered revolutions have shown
with wonderful persistence the contrasts between the
expected results of political systems and the achieved
results. It has been no less thus with proposed systems of
social re-organization, so far as they have been tried. Save
where celibacy has been insisted on, their history has been
everywhere one of disaster; ending with the history of
Cabet’s Icarian colony lately given by one of its members,
Madame Fleury Robinson, in <i>The Open Court</i>—a history of
splittings, re-splittings and
re-re-splittings, accompanied by <span class="xxpn" id="p458">{458}</span>
numerous individual secessions and final dissolution. And
for the failure of such social schemes, as for the failure of
the political schemes, there has been one general cause.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Metamorphosis is the universal law, exemplified throughout
the Heavens and on the Earth: especially throughout
the organic world; and above all in the animal division
of it. No creature, save the simplest and most minute,
commences its existence in a form like that which it
eventually assumes; and in most cases the unlikeness is
great—so great that kinship between the first and the last
forms would be incredible were it not daily demonstrated
in every poultry-yard and every garden. More than this
is true. The changes of form are often several: each of them
being an apparently complete transformation—egg, larva,
pupa, imago, for example. And this universal metamorphosis,
displayed alike in the development of a planet and
of every seed which germinates on its surface, holds also of
societies, whether taken as wholes or in their separate
institutions. No one of them ends as it begins; and the difference
between its original structure and its ultimate structure
is such that, at the outset, change of the one into the other
would have seemed incredible. In the rudest tribe the
chief, obeyed as leader in war, loses his distinctive position
when the fighting is over; and even where continued warfare
has produced permanent chieftainship, the chief, building
his own hut, getting his own food, making his own implements,
differs from others only by his predominant influence.
There is no sign that in course of time, by conquests and
unions of tribes, and consolidations of clusters so formed
with other such clusters, until a nation has been produced,
there will originate from the primitive chief, one who, as czar
or emperor, surrounded with pomp and ceremony, has despotic
power over scores of millions, exercised through hundreds of
thousands of soldiers and hundreds of thousands of officials.
When the early Christian
missionaries, having humble <span class="xxpn" id="p459">{459}</span>
externals and passing self-denying lives, spread over pagan
Europe, preaching forgiveness of injuries and the returning
of good for evil, no one dreamt that in course of time their
rep­re­sen­ta­tives would form a vast hierarchy, possessing
everywhere a large part of the land, distinguished by the
haughtiness of its members grade above grade, ruled by
military bishops who led their retainers to battle, and
headed by a pope exercising supreme power over kings.
So, too, has it been with that very industrial system which
many are now so eager to replace. In its original form
there was no prophecy of the factory-system or kindred
organizations of workers. Differing from them only as
being the head of his house, the master worked along with
his apprentices and a journeyman or two, sharing with
them his table and accommodation, and himself selling
their joint produce. Only with industrial growth did there
come employment of a larger number of assistants, and a
relinquishment, on the part of the master, of all other
business than that of superintendence. And only in the
course of recent times did there evolve the organizations
under which the labours of hundreds and thousands of men
receiving wages, are regulated by various orders of paid
officials under a single or multiple head. These originally
small, semi-socialistic, groups of producers, like the compound
families or house-communities of early ages, slowly
dissolved because they could not hold their ground: the
larger establishments, with better sub-division of labour,
succeeded because they ministered to the wants of society
more effectually. But we need not go back through the
centuries to trace transformations sufficiently great and
unexpected. On the day when £30,000 a year in aid of
education was voted as an experiment, the name of idiot
would have been given to an opponent who prophesied
that in 50 years the sum spent through imperial taxes and
local rates would amount to £10,000,000 or who said that the
aid to education would be followed by aids
to feeding and <span class="xxpn" id="p460">{460}</span>
clothing, or who said that parents and children, alike
deprived of all option, would, even if starving, be compelled
by fine or imprisonment to conform, and receive that
which, with papal assumption, the State calls education.
No one, I say, would have dreamt that out of so innocent-looking
a germ would have so quickly evolved this tyrannical
system, tamely submitted to by people who fancy
themselves free.</p>

<p>Thus in social arrangements, as in all other things,
change is inevitable. It is foolish to suppose that new
institutions set up, will long retain the character given
them by those who set them up. Rapidly or slowly they
will be transformed into institutions unlike those intended—so
unlike as even to be unrecognizable by their
devisers. And what, in the case before us, will be the
metamorphosis? The answer pointed to by instances above
given, and warranted by various analogies, is manifest.</p>

<p>A cardinal trait in all advancing organization is the
development of the regulative apparatus. If the parts of
a whole are to act together, there must be appliances by
which their actions are directed; and in proportion as the
whole is large and complex, and has many requirements
to be met by many agencies, the directive apparatus must
be extensive, elaborate, and powerful. That it is thus with
individual organisms needs no saying; and that it must be
thus with social organisms is obvious. Beyond the regulative
apparatus such as in our own society is required for
carrying on national defence and maintaining public order
and personal safety, there must, under the <i>régime</i> of
socialism, be a regulative apparatus everywhere controlling
all kinds of production and distribution, and everywhere
apportioning the shares of products of each kind required
for each locality, each working establishment, each individual.
Under our existing voluntary coöperation, with
its free contracts and its competition, production and
distribution need no official oversight. Demand and <span class="xxpn" id="p461">{461}</span>
supply, and the desire of each man to gain a living by
supplying the needs of his fellows, spontaneously evolve
that wonderful system whereby a great city has its food
daily brought round to all doors or stored at adjacent
shops; has clothing for its citizens everywhere at hand in
multitudinous varieties; has its houses and furniture and
fuel ready made or stocked in each locality; and has
mental pabulum from halfpenny papers hourly hawked
round, to weekly shoals of novels, and less abundant books
of instruction, furnished without stint for small payments.
And throughout the kingdom, production as well as distribution
is similarly carried on with the smallest amount of
superintendence which proves efficient; while the quantities
of the numerous commodities required daily in each
locality are adjusted without any other agency than the
pursuit of profit. Suppose now that this industrial <i>régime</i>
of willinghood, acting spontaneously, is replaced by a <i>régime</i>
of industrial obedience, enforced by public officials. Imagine
the vast ad­min­i­stra­tion required for that distribution of
all commodities to all people in every city, town and
village, which is now effected by traders! Imagine, again,
the still more vast ad­min­i­stra­tion required for doing all
that farmers, manufacturers, and merchants do; having
not only its various orders of local superintendents, but its
sub-centres and chief centres needed for apportioning the
quantities of each thing everywhere needed, and the
adjustment of them to the requisite times. Then add the
staffs wanted for working mines, railways, roads, canals;
the staffs required for conducting the importing and
exporting businesses and the ad­min­i­stra­tion of mercantile
shipping; the staffs required for supplying towns not only
with water and gas but with locomotion by tramways,
omnibuses, and other vehicles, and for the distribution of
power, electric and other. Join with these the existing
postal, telegraphic, and telephonic ad­min­i­stra­tions; and
finally those of the police and army, by
which the dictates <span class="xxpn" id="p462">{462}</span>
of this immense consolidated regulative system are to be
everywhere enforced. Imagine all this and then ask what
will be the position of the actual workers! Already on the
continent, where governmental organizations are more
elaborate and coercive than here, there are chronic complaints
of the tyranny of bureaucracies—the <i>hauteur</i> and
brutality of their members. What will these become when
not only the more public actions of citizens are controlled,
but there is added this far more extensive control of
all their respective daily duties? What will happen
when the various divisions of this vast army of officials,
united by interests common to officialism—the interests
of the regulators <i>versus</i> those of the regulated—have
at their command whatever force is needful to suppress
insubordination and act as “saviours of society”? Where
will be the actual diggers and miners and smelters
and weavers, when those who order and superintend,
everywhere arranged class above class, have come, after
some generations, to inter-marry with those of kindred
grades, under feelings such as are operative in existing
classes; and when there have been so produced a series of
castes rising in superiority; and when all these, having
everything in their own power, have arranged modes of
living for their own advantage: eventually forming a new
aristocracy far more elaborate and better organized than
the old? How will the individual worker fare if he is
dissatisfied with his treatment—thinks that he has not
an adequate share of the products, or has more to do
than can rightly be demanded, or wishes to undertake
a function for which he feels himself fitted but which is
not thought proper for him by his superiors, or desires to
make an independent career for himself? This dissatisfied
unit in the immense machine will be told he must submit
or go. The mildest penalty for disobedience will be industrial
excommunication. And if an international organization
of labour is formed as proposed, exclusion
in one country <span class="xxpn" id="p463">{463}</span>
will mean exclusion in all others—industrial excommunication
will mean starvation.</p>

<p>That things must take this course is a conclusion reached
not by deduction only, nor only by induction from those
experiences of the past instanced above, nor only from
consideration of the analogies furnished by organisms of
all orders; but it is reached also by observation of cases
daily under our eyes. The truth that the regulative
structure always tends to increase in power, is illustrated
by every established body of men. The history of each
learned society, or society for other purpose, shows how
the staff, permanent or partially permanent, sways the
proceedings and determines the actions of the society with
but little resistance, even when most members of the society
disapprove: the repugnance to anything like a revolutionary
step being ordinarily an efficient deterrent. So is it with
joint-stock companies—those owning railways for example.
The plans of a board of directors are usually authorized
with little or no discussion; and if there is any considerable
opposition, this is forthwith crushed by an overwhelming
number of proxies sent by those who always support the
existing ad­min­i­stra­tion. Only when the misconduct is extreme
does the resistance of shareholders suffice to displace the
ruling body. Nor is it otherwise with societies formed of
working men and having the interests of labour especially
at heart—the trades-unions. In these, too, the regulative
agency becomes all powerful. Their members, even when
they dissent from the policy pursued, habitually yield to the
authorities they have set up. As they cannot secede without
making enemies of their fellow workmen, and often losing
all chance of employment, they succumb. We are shown,
too, by the late congress, that already, in the general
organization of trades-unions so recently formed, there are
complaints of “wire-pullers” and “bosses” and “permanent
officials.” If, then, this supremacy of the regulators is
seen in bodies of quite modern origin, formed
of men who <span class="xxpn" id="p464">{464}</span>
have, in many of the cases instanced, unhindered powers
of asserting their independence, what will the supremacy of
the regulators become in long-established bodies, in bodies
which have become vast and highly organized, and in bodies
which, instead of controlling only a small part of the unit’s
life, control the whole of his life?</p>

<p class="padtopb">Again there will come the rejoinder—“We shall guard
against all that. Everybody will be educated; and all, with
their eyes constantly open to the abuse of power, will be
quick to prevent it.” The worth of these expectations would
be small even could we not identify the causes which
will bring disappointment; for in human affairs the most
promising schemes go wrong in ways which no one anticipated.
But in this case the going wrong will be necessitated
by causes which are conspicuous. The working of institutions
is determined by men’s characters; and the existing
defects in their characters will inevitably bring about the
results above indicated. There is no adequate endowment
of those sentiments required to prevent the growth
of a despotic bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Were it needful to dwell on indirect evidence, much might
be made of that furnished by the behaviour of the so-called
Liberal party—a party which, relinquishing the original
conception of a leader as a mouthpiece for a known and
accepted policy, thinks itself bound to accept a policy which
its leader springs upon it without consent or warning—a
party so utterly without the feeling and idea implied by
liberalism, as not to resent this trampling on the right of
private judgment, which constitutes the root of liberalism—nay,
a party which vilifies as renegade liberals, those of its
members who refuse to surrender their independence! But
without occupying space with indirect proofs that the mass
of men have not the natures required to check the development
of tyrannical officialism, it will suffice to contemplate
the direct proofs furnished by those
classes among whom <span class="xxpn" id="p465">{465}</span>
the socialistic idea most predominates, and who think
themselves most interested in propagating it—the operative
classes. These would constitute the great body of the
socialistic organization, and their characters would determine
its nature. What, then, are their characters as displayed
in such organizations as they have already formed?</p>

<p>Instead of the selfishness of the employing classes and
the selfishness of competition, we are to have the unselfishness
of a mutually-aiding system. How far is this
unselfishness now shown in the behaviour of working men
to one another? What shall we say to the rules limiting
the numbers of new hands admitted into each trade, or
to the rules which hinder ascent from inferior classes of
workers to superior classes? One does not see in such
regulations any of that altruism by which socialism is to be
pervaded. Contrariwise, one sees a pursuit of private
interests no less keen than among traders. Hence, unless
we suppose that men’s natures will be suddenly exalted,
we must conclude that the pursuit of private interests
will sway the doings of all the component classes in a
socialistic society.</p>

<p>With passive disregard of others’ claims goes active
encroachment on them. “Be one of us or we will cut off
your means of living,” is the usual threat of each trades-union
to outsiders of the same trade. While their members
insist on their own freedom to combine and fix the rates at
which they will work (as they are perfectly justified in
doing), the freedom of those who disagree with them is not
only denied but the assertion of it is treated as a crime.
Individuals who maintain their rights to make their own
contracts are vilified as “blacklegs” and “traitors,” and
meet with violence which would be merciless were there no
legal penalties and no police. Along with this trampling
on the liberties of men of their own class, there goes
peremptory dictation to the employing class: not prescribed
terms and working arrangements only
shall be conformed <span class="xxpn" id="p466">{466}</span>
to, but none save those belonging to their body shall be
employed—nay, in some cases, there shall be a strike if the
employer carries on transactions with trading bodies that
give work to non-union men. Here, then, we are variously
shown by trades-unions, or at any rate by the newer trades-unions,
a determination to impose their regulations without
regard to the rights of those who are to be coerced. So
complete is the inversion of ideas and sentiments that
maintenance of these rights is regarded as vicious and
trespass upon them as virtuous.<a class="afnanch" href="#fn45" id="fnanch45">45</a></p>

<p>Along with this aggressiveness in one direction there
goes submissiveness in another direction. The coercion of
outsiders by unionists is paralleled only by their subjection
to their leaders. That they may conquer in the struggle
they surrender their individual liberties and individual
judgments, and show no resentment however dictatorial may
be the rule exercised over them. Everywhere we see such
subordination that bodies of workmen unanimously leave
their work or return to it as their authorities order them.
Nor do they resist when taxed all round to support strikers
whose acts they may or may not approve, but instead, ill-treat
recalcitrant members of their body
who do not subscribe. <span class="xxpn" id="p467">{467}</span></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch45" id="fn45">45</a>
Marvellous are the conclusions men reach when once they desert the
simple principle, that each man should be allowed to pursue the objects of
life, restrained only by the limits which the similar pursuits of their objects
by other men impose. A generation ago we heard loud assertions of ‘the
right to labour,’ that is, the right to have labour provided; and there are
still not a few who think the community bound to find work for each person.
Compare this with the doctrine current in France at the time when the
monarchical power culminated; namely, that ‘the right of working is a
royal right which the prince can sell and the subjects must buy.’ This
contrast is startling enough; but a contrast still more startling is being
provided for us. We now see a resuscitation of the despotic doctrine,
differing only by the substitution of Trades-Unions for kings. For now
that Trades-Unions are becoming universal, and each artisan has to pay
prescribed monies to one or another of them, with the alternative of being
a non-unionist to whom work is denied by force, it has come to this, that
the right to labour is a Trade-Union right, which the Trade-Union can sell
and the individual
worker must buy!</p></div>

<p>The traits thus shown must be operative in any new
social organization, and the question to be asked is—What
will result from their operation when they are relieved
from all restraints? At present the separate bodies of men
displaying them are in the midst of a society partially
passive, partially antagonistic; are subject to the criticisms
and reprobations of an independent press; and are under
the control of law, enforced by police. If in these circumstances
these bodies habitually take courses which override
individual freedom, what will happen when, instead of
being only scattered parts of the community, governed by
their separate sets of regulators, they constitute the whole
community, governed by a consolidated system of such
regulators; when functionaries of all orders, including those
who officer the press, form parts of the regulative organization;
and when the law is both enacted and administered
by this regulative organization? The fanatical adherents
of a social theory are capable of taking any measures, no
matter how extreme, for carrying out their views: holding,
like the merciless priesthoods of past times, that the end
justifies the means. And when a general socialistic organization
has been established, the vast, ramified, and consolidated
body of those who direct its activities, using
without check whatever coercion seems to them needful in
the interests of the system (which will practically become
their own interests) will have no hesitation in imposing
their rigorous rule over the entire lives of the actual
workers; until, eventually, there is developed an official
oligarchy, with its various grades, exercising a tyranny more
gigantic and more terrible than any which the world has seen.</p>

<p class="padtopb">Let me again repudiate an erroneous inference. Any
one who supposes that the foregoing argument implies
contentment with things as they are, makes a profound
mistake. The present social state is transitional, as past
social states have been transitional. There
will, I hope <span class="xxpn" id="p468">{468}</span>
and believe, come a future social state differing as much
from the present as the present differs from the past
with its mailed barons and defenceless serfs. In <i>Social
Statics</i>, as well as in <i>The Study of Sociology</i> and in <i>Political
Institutions</i>, is clearly shown the desire for an organization
more conducive to the happiness of men at large than
that which exists. My opposition to socialism results from
the belief that it would stop the progress to such a higher
state and bring back a lower state. Nothing but the slow
modification of human nature by the discipline of social
life, can produce permanently advantageous changes.</p>

<p>A fundamental error pervading the thinking of nearly
all parties, political and social, is that evils admit of
immediate and radical remedies. “If you will but do this,
the mischief will be prevented.” “Adopt my plan and
the suffering will disappear.” “The corruption will unquestionably
be cured by enforcing this measure.” Everywhere
one meets with beliefs, expressed or implied, of these
kinds. They are all ill-founded. It is possible to remove
causes which intensify the evils; it is possible to change
the evils from one form into another; and it is possible, and
very common, to exacerbate the evils by the efforts made to
prevent them; but anything like immediate cure is impossible.
In the course of thousands of years mankind have,
by multiplication, been forced out of that original savage
state in which small numbers supported themselves on wild
food, into the civilized state in which the food required for
supporting great numbers can be got only by continuous
labour. The nature required for this last mode of life is
widely different from the nature required for the first;
and long-continued pains have to be passed through in
re-moulding the one into the other. Misery has necessarily
to be borne by a constitution out of harmony with its conditions;
and a constitution inherited from primitive men is
out of harmony with the conditions imposed on existing
men. Hence it is impossible to
establish forthwith a <span class="xxpn" id="p469">{469}</span>
satisfactory social state. No such nature as that which has
filled Europe with millions of armed men, here eager for
conquest and there for revenge—no such nature as that
which prompts the nations called Christian to vie with one
another in filibustering expeditions all over the world,
regardless of the claims of aborigines, while their tens of
thousands of priests of the religion of love look on approvingly—no
such nature as that which, in dealing with
weaker races, goes beyond the primitive rule of life for
life, and for one life takes many lives—no such nature, I
say, can, by any device, be framed into a harmonious community.
The root of all well-ordered social action is a
sentiment of justice, which at once insists on personal
freedom and is solicitous for the like freedom of others;
and there at present exists but a very inadequate amount
of this sentiment.</p>

<p>Hence the need for further long continuance of a social
discipline which requires each man to carry on his activities
with due regard to the like claims of others to carry on
their activities; and which, while it insists that he shall
have all the benefits his conduct naturally brings, insists
also that he shall not saddle on others the evils his conduct
naturally brings: unless they freely undertake to bear them.
And hence the belief that endeavours to elude this discipline,
will not only fail, but will bring worse evils than
those to be escaped.</p>

<p>It is not, then, chiefly in the interests of the employing
classes that socialism is to be resisted, but much more in
the interests of the employed classes. In one way or
other production must be regulated; and the regulators,
in the nature of things, must always be a small class as
compared with the actual producers.
Under voluntary coöperation
as at present carried on, the regulators, pursuing
their personal interests, take as large a share of the
produce as they can get; but, as we are daily shown by
trades-union successes, are restrained in
the selfish pursuit <span class="xxpn" id="p470">{470}</span>
of their ends. Under that compulsory coöperation which
socialism would necessitate, the regulators, pursuing their
personal interests with no less selfishness, could not be
met by the combined resistance of free workers; and their
power, unchecked as now by refusals to work save on
prescribed terms, would grow and ramify and consolidate
till it became irresistible. The ultimate result, as I have
before pointed out, must be a society like that of ancient
Peru, dreadful to contemplate, in which the mass of the
people, elaborately regimented in groups of 10, 50, 100,
500, and 1000, ruled by officers of corresponding grades,
and tied to their districts, were superintended in their
private lives as well as in their industries, and toiled
hopelessly for the support of
the governmental organization.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h3>I.—A <span class="smcap">C<b>ONVERSATION</b></span>:
<i>October 20, 1882</i>.</h3>

<p>Has what you have seen answered your expectations&#x202f;?</p></div>

<p>It has far exceeded them. Such books about America
as I had looked into had given me no adequate idea of
the immense developments of
material civilization which <span class="xxpn" id="p472">{472}</span>
I have everywhere found. The extent, wealth, and magnificence
of your cities, and especially the splendour of
New York, have altogether astonished me. Though I have
not visited the wonder of the West, Chicago, yet some of
your minor modern places, such as Cleveland, have sufficiently
amazed me by the results of one generation’s activity.
Occasionally, when I have been in places of some ten
thousand inhabitants where the telephone is in general
use, I have felt somewhat ashamed of our own unenterprising
towns, many of which, of fifty thousand inhabitants
and more, make no use of it.</p>

<p>I suppose you recognize in these results the great
benefits of free institutions&#x202f;?</p>

<p>Ah&#x202f;! Now comes one of the inconveniences of interviewing.
I have been in the country less than two months,
have seen but a relatively small part of it, and but comparatively
few people, and yet you wish from me a definite
opinion on a difficult question.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will answer, subject to the qualification that
you are but giving your first impressions&#x202f;?</p>

<p>Well, with that understanding, I may reply that though
the free institutions have been partly the cause, I think
they have not been the chief cause. In the first place, the
American people have come into possession of an unparalleled
fortune—the mineral wealth and the vast tracts
of virgin soil producing abundantly with small cost of
culture. Manifestly, that alone goes a long way towards
producing this enormous prosperity. Then they have profited
by inheriting all the arts, appliances, and methods,
developed by older societies, while leaving behind the
obstructions existing in them. They have been able to
pick and choose from the products of all past experience,
appropriating the good and rejecting the bad. Then,
besides these favours of fortune, there are factors proper
to themselves. I perceive in American faces generally a
great amount of determination—a kind of
“do or die” <span class="xxpn" id="p473">{473}</span>
expression; and this trait of character, joined with a power
of work exceeding that of any other people, of course produces
an unparalleled rapidity of progress. Once more,
there is the inventiveness which, stimulated by the need
for economizing labour, has been so wisely fostered. Among
us in England, there are many foolish people who, while
thinking that a man who toils with his hands has an equitable
claim to the product, and if he has special skill may
rightly have the advantage of it, also hold that if a man
toils with his brain, perhaps for years, and, uniting genius
with perseverance, evolves some valuable invention, the
public may rightly claim the benefit. The Americans have
been more far-seeing. The enormous museum of patents
which I saw at Washington is significant of the attention
paid to inventors’ claims; and the nation profits immensely
from having in this direction (though not in all others)
recognized property in mental products. Beyond question,
in respect of mechanical appliances the Americans are
ahead of all nations. If along with your material progress
there went equal progress of a higher kind, there would
remain nothing to be wished.</p>

<p>That is an ambiguous qualification. What do you mean
by it&#x202f;?</p>

<p>You will understand me when I tell you what I was
thinking the other day. After pondering over what I have
seen of your vast manufacturing and trading establishments,
the rush of traffic in your street-cars and elevated railways,
your gigantic hotels and Fifth Avenue palaces, I was suddenly
reminded of the Italian Republics of the Middle Ages;
and recalled the fact that while there was growing up in
them great commercial activity, a development of the arts,
which made them the envy of Europe, and a building of
princely mansions which continue to be the admiration of
travellers, their people were gradually losing their freedom.</p>

<p>Do you mean this as a suggestion that we are doing
the like&#x202f;?</p>

<p>It seems to me that you are. You retain
the forms of <span class="xxpn" id="p474">{474}</span>
freedom; but, so far as I can gather, there has been a
considerable loss of the substance. It is true that those who
rule you do not do it by means of retainers armed with
swords; but they do it through regiments of men armed
with voting papers, who obey the word of command as
loyally as did the dependants of the old feudal nobles, and
who thus enable their leaders to override the general will,
and make the community submit to their exactions as
effectually as their prototypes of old. It is doubtless true
that each of your citizens votes for the candidate he chooses
for this or that office, from President downwards; but his
hand is guided by an agency behind which leaves him
scarcely any choice. “Use your political power as we tell
you, or else throw it away,” is the alternative offered to the
citizen. The political machinery as it is now worked, has
little resemblance to that contemplated at the outset of
your political life. Manifestly, those who framed your Constitution
never dreamed that twenty thousand citizens would
go to the poll led by a “boss.” America exemplifies at the
other end of the social scale, a change analogous to that
which has taken place under sundry despotisms. You
know that in Japan, before the recent Revolution, the
divine ruler, the Mikado, nominally supreme, was practically
a puppet in the hands of his chief minister, the
Shogun. Here it seems to me that “the sovereign people”
is fast becoming a puppet which moves and speaks as wire-pullers
determine.</p>

<p>Then you think that Republican institutions are a failure&#x202f;?</p>

<p>By no means: I imply no such conclusion. Thirty years
ago, when often discussing politics with an English friend,
and defending Republican institutions, as I always have
done and do still, and when he urged against me the ill-working
of such institutions over here, I habitually replied
that the Americans got their form of government by
a happy accident, not by normal progress, and that they
would have to go back before they could go forward. What
has since happened seems to me to
have justified that <span class="xxpn" id="p475">{475}</span>
view; and what I see now, confirms me in it. America
is showing, on a larger scale than ever before, that “paper
Constitutions” will not work as they are intended to
work. The truth, first recognized by Mackintosh, that
Constitutions are not made but grow, which is part
of the larger truth that societies, throughout their whole
organizations, are not made but grow, at once, when
accepted, disposes of the notion that you can work as
you hope any artificially-devised system of government.
It becomes an inference that if your political structure has
been manufactured and not grown, it will forthwith begin
to grow into something different from that intended—something
in harmony with the natures of the citizens, and
the conditions under which the society exists. And it
evidently has been so with you. Within the forms of your
Constitution there has grown up this organization of professional
politicians altogether uncontemplated at the outset,
which has become in large measure the ruling power.</p>

<p>But will not education and the diffusion of political
knowledge fit men for free institutions&#x202f;?</p>

<p>No. It is essentially a question of character, and only in
a secondary degree a question of knowledge. But for the
universal delusion about education as a panacea for political
evils, this would have been made sufficiently clear by the
evidence daily disclosed in your papers. Are not the men
who officer and control your Federal, your State, and your
Municipal organizations—who manipulate your caucuses
and conventions, and run your partisan campaigns—all
educated men? And has their education prevented them
from engaging in, or permitting, or condoning, the
briberies, lobbyings, and other corrupt methods which
vitiate the actions of your ad­min­i­stra­tions? Perhaps party
newspapers exaggerate these things; but what am I to
make of the testimony of your civil service reformers—men
of all parties? If I understand the matter aright,
they are attacking, as vicious and
dangerous, a system <span class="xxpn" id="p476">{476}</span>
which has grown up under the natural spontaneous working
of your free institutions—are exposing vices which
education has proved powerless to prevent?</p>

<p>Of course, ambitious and unscrupulous men will secure
the offices, and education will aid them in their selfish
purposes. But would not those purposes be thwarted, and
better Government secured, by raising the standard of
knowledge among the people at large&#x202f;?</p>

<p>Very little. The current theory is that if the young are
taught what is right, and the reasons why it is right, they
will do what is right when they grow up. But considering
what religious teachers have been doing these two thousand
years, it seems to me that all history is against the conclusion,
as much as is the conduct of these well-educated
citizens I have referred to; and I do not see why you
expect better results among the masses. Personal interests
will sway the men in the ranks, as they sway the men
above them; and the education which fails to make the
last consult public good rather than private good, will fail to
make the first do it. The benefits of political purity are so
general and remote, and the profit to each individual is so
inconspicuous, that the common citizen, educate him as you
like, will habitually occupy himself with his personal affairs,
and hold it not worth his while to fight against each abuse
as soon as it appears. Not lack of information, but lack of
certain moral sentiment, is the root of the evil.</p>

<p>You mean that people have not a sufficient sense of
public duty&#x202f;?</p>

<p>Well, that is one way of putting it; but there is a more
specific way. Probably it will surprise you if I say the
American has not, I think, a sufficiently quick sense of his
own claims, and, at the same time, as a necessary consequence,
not a sufficiently quick sense of the claims of others—for
the two traits are organically related. I observe that
they tolerate various small interferences and dictations
which Englishmen are prone to resist. I am
told that the <span class="xxpn" id="p477">{477}</span>
English are remarked on for their tendency to grumble in
such cases; and I have no doubt it is true.</p>

<p>Do you think it worth while for people to make themselves
disagreeable by resenting every trifling aggression&#x202f;? We
Americans think it involves too much loss of time and
temper, and doesn’t pay.</p>

<p>Exactly; that is what I mean by character. It is this
easy-going readiness to permit small trespasses, because it
would be troublesome or profitless or unpopular to oppose
them, which leads to the habit of acquiescence in wrong,
and the decay of free institutions. Free institutions can be
maintained only by citizens, each of whom is instant to
oppose every illegitimate act, every assumption of supremacy,
every official excess of power, however trivial it may
seem. As Hamlet says, there is such a thing as “greatly
to find quarrel in a straw,” when the straw implies a
principle. If, as you say of the American, he pauses to
consider whether he can afford the time and trouble—whether
it will pay, corruption is sure to creep in. All
these lapses from higher to lower forms begin in trifling
ways, and it is only by incessant watchfulness that they can
be prevented. As one of your early statesmen said—“The
price of liberty is eternal vigilance.” But it is far less
against foreign aggressions upon national liberty that this
vigilance is required, than against the insidious growth of
domestic interferences with personal liberty. In some
private ad­min­i­stra­tions which I have been concerned with,
I have often insisted that instead of assuming, as people
usually do, that things are going right until it is proved
that they are going wrong, the proper course is to assume
that they are going wrong until it is proved that they
are going right. You will find continually that private
corporations, such as joint-stock banking companies, come
to grief from not acting on this principle; and what holds
of these small and simple private ad­min­i­stra­tions holds still
more of the great and
complex public ad­min­i­stra­tions. <span class="xxpn" id="p478">{478}</span>
People are taught, and I suppose believe, that the heart
of man “is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked;” and yet, strangely enough, believing this, they
place implicit trust in those they appoint to this or that
function. I do not think so ill of human nature; but, on
the other hand, I do not think so well of human nature as
to believe it will go straight without being watched.</p>

<p>You hinted that while Americans do not assert their own
individualities sufficiently in small matters, they, reciprocally,
do not sufficiently respect the individualities of others.</p>

<p>Did I? Here, then, comes another of the inconveniences
of interviewing. I should have kept this opinion to myself
if you had asked me no questions; and now I must either
say what I do not think, which I cannot, or I must refuse
to answer, which, perhaps, will be taken to mean more than
I intend, or I must specify, at the risk of giving offence.
As the least evil, I suppose I must do the last. The trait I
refer to comes out in various ways, small and great. It is
shown by the disrespectful manner in which individuals are
dealt with in your journals—the placarding of public men
in sensational headings, the dragging of private people and
their affairs into print. There seems to be a notion that the
public have a right to intrude on private life as far as they
like; and this I take to be a kind of moral trespassing.
Then, in a larger way, the trait is seen in this damaging of
private property by your elevated railways without making
compensation; and it is again seen in the doings of railway
autocrats, not only when overriding the rights of shareholders,
but in dominating over courts of justice and State
governments. The fact is that free institutions can be
properly worked only by men, each of whom is jealous of
his own rights, and also sympathetically jealous of the
rights of others—who will neither himself aggress on his
neighbours in small things or great, nor tolerate aggression
on them by others. The Republican form of government
is the highest form of government; but because
of this it <span class="xxpn" id="p479">{479}</span>
requires the highest type of human nature—a type
nowhere at present existing. We have not grown up to it;
nor have you.</p>

<p>But we thought, Mr. Spencer, you were in favour of
free government in the sense of relaxed restraints, and
letting men and things very much alone, or what is called
<i>laissez faire</i>&#x202f;?</p>

<p>That is a persistent misunderstanding of my opponents.
Everywhere, along with the reprobation of Government
intrusion into various spheres where private activities
should be left to themselves, I have contended that in its
special sphere, the maintenance of equitable relations
among citizens, governmental action should be extended
and elaborated.</p>

<p>To return to your various criticisms, must I then understand
that you think unfavourably of our future&#x202f;?</p>

<p>No one can form anything more than vague and general
conclusions respecting your future. The factors are too
numerous, too vast, too far beyond measure in their quantities
and intensities. The world has never before seen social
phenomena at all comparable with those presented in the
United States. A society spreading over enormous tracts,
while still preserving its political continuity, is a new thing.
This progressive incorporation of vast bodies of immigrants
of various bloods, has never occurred on such a scale before.
Large empires, composed of different peoples, have, in
previous cases, been formed by conquest and annexation.
Then your immense <i>plexus</i> of railways and telegraphs
tends to consolidate this vast aggregate of States in a way
that no such aggregate has ever before been consolidated.
And there are many minor co-operating causes, unlike those
hitherto known. No one can say how it is all going to
work out. That there will come hereafter troubles of
various kinds, and very grave ones, seems highly probable;
but all nations have had, and will have, their troubles.
Already you have triumphed over one
great trouble, and <span class="xxpn" id="p480">{480}</span>
may reasonably hope to triumph over others. It may, I
think, be concluded that, both because of its size and the
heterogeneity of its components, the American nation will
be a long time in evolving its ultimate form, but that its
ultimate form will be high. One great result is, I think,
tolerably clear. From biological truths it is to be inferred
that the eventual mixture of the allied varieties of the
Aryan race forming the population, will produce a finer
type of man than has hitherto existed; and a type of man
more plastic, more adaptable, more capable of undergoing
the modifications needful for complete social life. I think
that whatever difficulties they may have to surmount, and
whatever tribulations they may have to pass through, the
Americans may reasonably look forward to a time when
they will have produced a civilization grander than any the
world has known.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>II.—A <span class="smcap">S<b>PEECH</b></span>:</h3>

<div class="dh3pre">
<i>Delivered on the occasion of a Complimentary Dinner in
New York, on November 9, 1882.</i></div></div>

<p>Mr. President and Gentlemen:—Along with your kindness
there comes to me a great unkindness from Fate; for,
now that, above all times in my life, I need full command
of what powers of speech I possess, disturbed health so
threatens to interfere with them that I fear I shall very
inadequately express myself. Any failure in my response
you must please ascribe, in part at least, to a greatly disordered
nervous system. Regarding you as representing
Americans at large, I feel that the occasion is one on which
arrears of thanks are due. I ought to begin with the time,
some two-and-twenty years ago, when my highly valued
friend Professor Youmans, making efforts to diffuse my
books here, interested on their behalf the Messrs. Appleton,
who have ever treated me so honourably and so handsomely;
and I ought to detail from that time
onward the various <span class="xxpn" id="p481">{481}</span>
marks and acts of sympathy by which I have been encouraged
in a struggle which was for many years disheartening.
But, intimating thus briefly my general indebtedness to my
numerous friends, most of them unknown, on this side of
the Atlantic, I must name more especially the many attentions
and proffered hospitalities met with during my late
tour, as well as, lastly and chiefly, this marked expression of
the sympathies and good wishes which many of you have
travelled so far to give, at great cost of that time which is
so precious to the American. I believe I may truly say,
that the better health which you have so cordially wished
me, will be in a measure furthered by the wish; since all
pleasurable emotion is conducive to health, and, as you will
fully believe, the remembrance of this event will ever continue
to be a source of pleasurable emotion, exceeded by
few, if any, of my remembrances.</p>

<p>And now that I have thanked you, sincerely though too
briefly, I am going to find fault with you. Already, in some
remarks drawn from me respecting American affairs and
American character, I have passed criticisms, which have
been accepted far more good-humouredly than I could
have reasonably expected; and it seems strange that I
should now propose again to transgress. However, the
fault I have to comment upon is one which most will
scarcely regard as a fault. It seems to me that in one
respect Americans have diverged too widely from savages,
I do not mean to say that they are in general unduly
civilized. Throughout large parts of the population, even
in long-settled regions, there is no excess of those virtues
needed for the maintenance of social harmony. Especially
out in the West, men’s dealings do not yet betray too much
of the “sweetness and light” which we are told distinguish
the cultured man from the barbarian. Nevertheless, there
is a sense in which my assertion is true. You know that
the primitive man lacks power of application. Spurred by
hunger, by danger, by revenge, he
can exert himself <span class="xxpn" id="p482">{482}</span>
energetically for a time; but his energy is spasmodic.
Monotonous daily toil is impossible to him. It is otherwise
with the more developed man. The stern discipline of
social life has gradually increased the aptitude for persistent
industry; until, among us, and still more among you, work
has become with many a passion. This contrast of nature
has another aspect. The savage thinks only of present
satisfactions, and leaves future satisfactions uncared for.
Contrariwise, the American, eagerly pursuing a future good,
almost ignores what good the passing day offers him; and
when the future good is gained, he neglects that while
striving for some still remoter good.</p>

<p>What I have seen and heard during my stay among you
has forced on me the belief that this slow change from
habitual inertness to persistent activity has reached an
extreme from which there must begin a counterchange—a
reaction. Everywhere I have been struck with the
number of faces which told in strong lines of the burdens
that had to be borne. I have been struck, too, with the
large proportion of gray-haired men; and inquiries have
brought out the fact, that with you the hair commonly
begins to turn some ten years earlier than with us. Moreover,
in every circle I have met men who had themselves
suffered from nervous collapse due to stress of business, or
named friends who had either killed themselves by overwork,
or had been permanently incapacitated, or had wasted long
periods in endeavours to recover health. I do but echo the
opinion of all the observant persons I have spoken to, that
immense injury is being done by this high-pressure life—the
physique is being undermined. That subtle thinker
and poet whom you have lately had to mourn, Emerson,
says, in his essay on the Gentleman, that the first requisite
is that he shall be a good animal. The requisite is a general
one—it extends to the man, to the father, to the citizen.
We hear a great deal about “the vile body;” and many
are encouraged by the phrase to transgress
the laws of <span class="xxpn" id="p483">{483}</span>
health. But Nature quietly suppresses those who treat thus
disrespectfully one of her highest products, and leaves the
world to be peopled by the descendants of those who are
not so foolish.</p>

<p>Beyond these immediate mischiefs there are remoter
mischiefs. Exclusive devotion to work has the result that
amusements cease to please; and, when relaxation becomes
imperative, life becomes dreary from lack of its sole interest—the
interest in business. The remark current in England
that, when the American travels, his aim is to do the
greatest amount of sight-seeing in the shortest time, I find
current here also: it is recognized that the satisfaction of
getting on devours nearly all other satisfactions. When
recently at Niagara, which gave us a whole week’s pleasure,
I learned from the landlord of the hotel that most Americans
come one day and go away the next. Old Froissart, who
said of the English of his day that “they take their pleasures
sadly after their fashion,” would doubtless, if he lived now,
say of the Americans that they take their pleasures
hurriedly after their fashion. In large measure with us,
and still more with you, there is not that abandonment to
the moment which is requisite for full enjoyment; and this
abandonment is prevented by the ever-present sense of
multitudinous responsibilities. So that, beyond the serious
physical mischief caused by overwork, there is the further
mischief that it destroys what value there would otherwise
be in the leisure part of life.</p>

<p>Nor do the evils end here. There is the injury to
posterity. Damaged constitutions reappear in children, and
entail on them far more of ill than great fortunes yield
them of good. When life has been duly rationalized by
science, it will be seen that among a man’s duties, care of
the body is imperative; not only out of regard for personal
welfare, but also out of regard for descendants. His constitution
will be considered as an entailed estate, which he
ought to pass on uninjured, if not improved, to those who
follow; and it will be held that millions
bequeathed by him <span class="xxpn" id="p484">{484}</span>
will not compensate for feeble health and decreased ability
to enjoy life. Once more, there is the injury to fellow-citizens,
taking the shape of undue disregard of competitors.
I hear that a great trader among you deliberately
endeavoured to crush out every one whose business competed
with his own; and manifestly the man who, making himself
a slave to accumulation, absorbs an inordinate share of the
trade or profession he is engaged in, makes life harder for
all others engaged in it, and excludes from it many who
might otherwise gain competencies. Thus, besides the
egoistic motive, there are two altruistic motives which should
deter from this excess in work.</p>

<p>The truth is, there needs a revised ideal of life. Look
back through the past, or look abroad through the present,
and we find that the ideal of life is variable, and depends on
social conditions. Every one knows that to be a successful
warrior was the highest aim among all ancient peoples of
note, as it is still among many barbarous peoples. When
we remember that in the Norseman’s heaven the time was
to be passed in daily battles, with magical healing of
wounds, we see how deeply rooted may become the conception
that fighting is man’s proper business, and that
industry is fit only for slaves and people of low degree.
That is to say, when the chronic struggles of races necessitate
perpetual wars, there is evolved an ideal of life
adapted to the requirements. We have changed all that in
modern civilized societies; especially in England, and still
more in America. With the decline of militant activity, and
the growth of industrial activity, the occupations once
disgraceful have become honourable. The duty to work has
taken the place of the duty to fight; and in the one case,
as in the other, the ideal of life has become so well established
that scarcely any dream of questioning it. Practically,
business has been substituted for war as the purpose
of existence.</p>

<p>Is this modern ideal to survive throughout the future?
I think not. While all other
things undergo continuous <span class="xxpn" id="p485">{485}</span>
change, it is impossible that ideals should remain fixed. The
ancient ideal was appropriate to the ages of conquest by
man over man, and spread of the strongest races. The
modern ideal is appropriate to ages in which conquest of the
earth and subjection of the powers of Nature to human use,
is the predominant need. But hereafter, when both these ends
have in the main been achieved, the ideal formed will probably
differ considerably from the present one. May we not foresee
the nature of the difference? I think we may. Some twenty
years ago, a good friend of mine, and a good friend of yours
too, though you never saw him, John Stuart Mill, delivered
at St. Andrews an inaugural address on the occasion of his
appointment to the Lord Rectorship. It contained much
to be admired, as did all he wrote. There ran through it,
however, the tacit assumption that life is for learning and
working. I felt at the time that I should have liked to
take up the opposite thesis. I should have liked to contend
that life is not for learning, nor is life for working, but
learning and working are for life. The primary use of
knowledge is for such guidance of conduct under all
circumstances as shall make living complete. All other
uses of knowledge are secondary. It scarcely needs saying
that the primary use of work is that of supplying the
materials and aids to living completely; and that any other
uses of work are secondary. But in men’s conceptions the
secondary has in great measure usurped the place of the
primary. The apostle of culture as it is commonly conceived,
Mr. Matthew Arnold, makes little or no reference
to the fact that the first use of knowledge is the right
ordering of all actions; and Mr. Carlyle, who is a good
exponent of current ideas about work, insists on its virtues
for quite other reasons than that it achieves sustentation.
We may trace everywhere in human affairs a tendency to
transform the means into the end. All see that the miser
does this when, making the accumulation of money his sole
satisfaction, he forgets that money is of
value only to <span class="xxpn" id="p486">{486}</span>
purchase satisfactions. But it is less commonly seen that
the like is true of the work by which the money is accumulated—that
industry too, bodily or mental, is but a
means; and that it is as irrational to pursue it to the
exclusion of that complete living it subserves, as it is for the
miser to accumulate money and make no use of it. Hereafter,
when this age of active material progress has yielded
mankind its benefits, there will, I think, come a better
adjustment of labour and enjoyment. Among reasons for
thinking this, there is the reason that the process of evolution
throughout the organic world at large, brings an
increasing surplus of energies that are not absorbed in
fulfilling material needs, and points to a still larger surplus
for the humanity of the future. And there are other reasons,
which I must pass over. In brief, I may say that we have
had somewhat too much of “the gospel of work.” It is
time to preach the gospel of relaxation.</p>

<p>This is a very unconventional after-dinner speech.
Especially it will be thought strange that in returning
thanks I should deliver something very much like a homily.
But I have thought I could not better convey my thanks
than by the expression of a sympathy which issues in a fear.
If, as I gather, this intemperance in work affects more
especially the Anglo-American part of the population—if
there results an undermining of the physique, not only in
adults, but also in the young, who, as I learn from your
daily journals, are also being injured by overwork—if the
ultimate consequence should be a dwindling away of those
among you who are the inheritors of free institutions and
best adapted to them; then there will come a further
difficulty in the working out of that great future which lies
before the American nation. To my anxiety on this
account you must please ascribe the unusual character of
my remarks.</p>

<p>And now I must bid you farewell. When I sail by the <i>Germanic</i> on
Saturday, I shall bear with me pleasant <span class="xxpn" id="p487">{487}</span> remembrances of my
intercourse with many Americans, joined with regrets that my state of
health has prevented me from seeing a larger number.</p>

<p class="padtopb"><span class="smcap">P<b>OSTSCRIPT</b>.</span>—A few words may fitly be added respecting
the causes of this over-activity in American life—causes
which may be identified as having in recent times partially
operated among ourselves, and as having wrought kindred,
though less marked, effects. It is the more worth while to
trace the genesis of this undue absorption of the energies
in work, since it well serves to illustrate the general truth
which should be ever present to all legislators and politicians,
that the indirect and unforeseen results of any cause
affecting a society are frequently, if not habitually, greater
and more important than the direct and foreseen results.</p>

<p>This high pressure under which Americans exist, and
which is most intense in places like Chicago, where the
prosperity and rate of growth are greatest, is seen by many
intelligent Americans themselves to be an indirect result of
their free institutions and the absence of those class-distinctions
and restraints existing in older communities.
A society in which the man who dies a millionaire is so
often one who commenced life in poverty, and in which (to
paraphrase a French saying concerning the soldier) every
news-boy carries a president’s seal in his bag, is, by
consequence, a society in which all are subject to a stress of
competition for wealth and honour, greater than can exist
in a society whose members are nearly all prevented from
rising out of the ranks in which they were born, and have
but remote possibilities of acquiring fortunes. In those
European societies which have in great measure preserved
their old types of structure (as in our own society up to the
time when the great development of industrialism began to
open ever-multiplying careers for the producing and distributing
classes) there is so little chance of overcoming the
obstacles to any great rise in position
or possessions, that <span class="xxpn" id="p488">{488}</span>
nearly all have to be content with their places: entertaining
little or no thought of bettering themselves. A manifest concomitant
is that, fulfilling, with such efficiency as a moderate
competition requires, the daily tasks of their respective
situations, the majority become habituated to making the best
of such pleasures as their lot affords, during whatever leisure
they get. But it is otherwise where an immense growth of
trade multiplies greatly the chances of success to the enterprising;
and still more is it otherwise where class-restrictions
are partially removed or wholly absent. Not only
are more energy and thought put into the time daily
occupied in work, but the leisure comes to be trenched
upon, either literally by abridgment, or else by anxieties
concerning business. Clearly, the larger the number who,
under such conditions, acquire property, or achieve higher
positions, or both, the sharper is the spur to the rest. A
raised standard of activity establishes itself and goes on
rising. Public applause given to the successful, becoming
in communities thus circumstanced the most familiar kind
of public applause, increases continually the stimulus to
action. The struggle grows more and more strenuous,
and there comes an increasing dread of failure—a dread of
being “left,” as the Americans say: a significant word,
since it is suggestive of a race in which the harder any one
runs, the harder others have to run to keep up with him—a
word suggestive of that breathless haste with which each
passes from a success gained to the pursuit of a further
success. And on contrasting the English of to-day with
the English of a century ago, we may see how, in a considerable
measure, the like causes have entailed here
kindred results.</p>

<p>Even those who are not directly spurred on by this
intensified struggle for wealth and honour, are indirectly
spurred on by it. For one of its effects is to raise the
standard of living, and eventually to increase the average
rate of expenditure for all. Partly
for personal enjoyment, <span class="xxpn" id="p489">{489}</span>
but much more for the display which brings admiration,
those who acquire fortunes distinguish themselves by
luxurious habits. The more numerous they become, the
keener becomes the competition for that kind of public
attention given to those who make themselves conspicuous
by great expenditure. The competition spreads downwards
step by step; until, to be “respectable,” those having
relatively small means feel obliged to spend more on houses,
furniture, dress, and food; and are obliged to work the
harder to get the requisite larger income. This process of
causation is manifest enough among ourselves; and it is
still more manifest in America, where the extravagance in
style of living is greater than here.</p>

<p>Thus, though it seems beyond doubt that the removal of
all political and social barriers, and the giving to each
man an unimpeded career, must be purely beneficial; yet
there is (at first) a considerable set-off from the benefits.
Among those who in older communities have by laborious
lives gained distinction, some may be heard privately to
confess that “the game is not worth the candle;” and
when they hear of others who wish to tread in their steps,
shake their heads and say—“If they only knew!” Without
accepting in full so pessimistic an estimate of success,
we must still say that very generally the cost of the candle
deducts largely from the gain of the game. That which in
these exceptional cases holds among ourselves, holds more
generally in America. An intensified life, which may be
summed up as—great labour, great profit, great expenditure—has
for its concomitant a wear and tear which considerably
diminishes in one direction the good gained in
another. Added together, the daily strain through many
hours and the anxieties occupying many other hours—the
occupation of consciousness by feelings that are either indifferent
or painful, leaving relatively little time for occupation
of it by pleasurable feelings—tend to lower its level more
than its level is raised by the
gratifications of achievement <span class="xxpn" id="p490">{490}</span>
and the ac­com­pa­ny­ing benefits. So that it may, and in
many cases does, result that diminished happiness goes along
with increased prosperity. Unquestionably, as long as
order is fairly maintained, that absence of political and
social restraints which gives free scope to the struggles
for profit and honour, conduces greatly to material advance
of the society—develops the industrial arts, extends and
improves the business organizations, augments the wealth;
but that it raises the value of individual life, as measured
by the average state of its feeling, by no means follows.
That it will do so eventually, is certain; but that it does
so now seems, to say the least, very doubtful.</p>

<p>The truth is that a society and its members act and
react in such wise that while, on the one hand, the nature
of the society is determined by the natures of its members;
on the other hand, the activities of its members (and
presently their natures) are re-determined by the needs
of the society, as these alter: change in either entails
change in the other. It is an obvious implication that, to
a great extent the life of a society so sways the wills of its
members as to turn them to its ends. That which is
manifest during the militant stage, when the social aggregate
coerces its units into co-operation for defence, and
sacrifices many of their lives for its corporate preservation
holds under another form during the industrial stage, as we
at present know it. Though the co-operation of citizens
is now voluntary instead of compulsory; yet the social forces
impel them to achieve social ends while apparently achieving
only their own ends. The man who, carrying out an invention,
thinks only of private welfare to be thereby secured,
is in far larger measure working for public welfare: instance
the contrast between the fortune made by Watt and the wealth
which the steam-engine has given to mankind. He who
utilizes a new material, improves a method of production,
or introduces a better way of carrying on business, and
does this for the purpose of
distancing competitors, gains <span class="xxpn" id="p491">{491}</span>
for himself little compared with that which he gains for
the community by facilitating the lives of all. Either
unknowingly or in spite of themselves, Nature leads men by
purely personal motives to fulfil her ends: Nature being one
of our expressions for the Ultimate Cause of things, and the
end, remote when not proximate, being the highest form of
human life.</p>

<p>Hence no argument, however cogent, can be expected to
produce much effect: only here and there one may be
influenced. As in an actively militant stage of society it is
impossible to make many believe that there is any glory
preferable to that of killing enemies; so, where rapid
material growth is going on, and affords unlimited scope
for the energies of all, little can be done by insisting that
life has higher uses than work and accumulation. While
among the most powerful of feelings continue to be the
desire for public applause and dread of public censure—while
the anxiety to achieve distinction, now by conquering
enemies, now by beating competitors, continues predominant—while
the fear of public reprobation affects men more than
the fear of divine vengeance (as witness the long survival
of duelling in Christian societies); this excess of work which
ambition prompts, seems likely to continue with but small
qualification. The eagerness for the honour accorded to
success, first in war and then in commerce, has been indispensable
as a means to peopling the Earth with the higher
types of man, and the subjugation of its surface and its forces
to human use. Ambition may fitly come to bear a smaller
ratio to other motives, when the working out of these needs
is approaching completeness; and when also, by consequence,
the scope for satisfying ambition is diminishing. Those who
draw the obvious corollaries from the doctrine of Evolution—those
who believe that the process of modification upon
modification which has brought life to its present height
must raise it still higher, will anticipate that the “last
infirmity of noble mind” will in the
distant future slowly <span class="xxpn" id="p492">{492}</span>
decrease. As the sphere for achievement becomes smaller,
the desire for applause will lose that predominance which it
now has. A better ideal of life may simultaneously come to
prevail. When there is fully recognized the truth that
moral beauty is higher than intellectual power—when the
wish to be admired is in large measure replaced by the wish
to be loved; that strife for distinction which the present
phase of civilization shows us will be greatly moderated.
Along with other benefits may then come a rational proportioning
of work and relaxation; and the relative claims of
to-day and to-morrow may be properly balanced.

and present; being fortunate enough to secure the services of gentlemen competent to
carry on the process in the way I wished. Though this classified compilation of materials
was entered upon solely to facilitate my own work; yet, after having brought the mode of
clas­si­fi­ca­tion to a satisfactory form, and after having had some of the Tables filled up, I
decided to have the undertaking executed with a view to publication; the facts collected
and arranged for easy reference and convenient study of their relations, being so presented,
apart from hypothesis, as to aid all students of Social Science in testing such conclusions as
they have drawn and in drawing others.</p>

<p class="fsza">The Work consists of three large Divisions. Each comprises a set of Tables exhibiting
the facts as abstracted and classified, and a mass of quotations and abridged abstracts otherwise
classified, on which the statements contained in the Tables are based. The condensed
statements, arranged after a uniform manner, give, in each Table or succession of Tables,
the phenomena of all orders which each society presents—constitute an account of its morphology,
its physiology, and (if a society having a known history) its development. On the
other hand, the collected Extracts, serving as authorities for the statements in the Tables, are
(or, rather will be, when the Work is complete) classified primarily according to the kinds of
phenomena to which they refer, and secondarily according to the societies exhibiting these
phenomena; so that each kind of phenomenon as it is displayed in all societies, may be
separately studied with convenience.</p>

<p class="fsza">In further explanation I may say that the classified compilations and digests of materials
to be thus brought together under the title of <i>Descriptive Sociology</i>, are intended to supply the
student of Social Science with data, standing towards his conclusions in a relation like that
in which accounts of the structures and functions of different types of animals stand to the
conclusions of the biologist. Until there had been such systematic descriptions of different
kinds of organisms, as made it possible to compare the connexions, and forms, and actions,
and modes of origin, of their parts, the Science of Life could make no progress. And in
like manner, before there can be reached in Sociology, gen­er­al­i­za­tions having a certainty
making them worthy to be called scientific, there must be definite accounts of the institutions
and actions of societies of various types, and in various stages of evolution, so arranged
as to furnish the means of readily ascertaining what social phenomena are habitually
associated.</p>

<p class="fsza">Respecting the tabulation, devised for the purpose of exhibiting social phenomena in a
convenient way, I may explain that the primary aim has been so to present them that their
relations of simultaneity and succession may be seen at one view. As used for delineating
uncivilized societies, concerning which we have no records, the tabular form serves only to
display the various social traits as they are found to co-exist. But as used for delineating
societies having known histories, the tabular form is so employed as to exhibit not only the
connexions of phenomena existing at the same time, but also the connexions of phenomena
that succeed one another. By reading horizontally across a Table at any period, there may
be gained a knowledge of the traits of all orders displayed by the society at that period; while
by reading down each column, there may be gained a knowledge of the modifications which
each trait, structural or functional, underwent during successive periods.</p>

<p class="fsza">Of course, the tabular form fulfils these purposes but approximately. To preserve complete
simultaneity in the statements of facts, as read from side to side of the Tables, has proved
impracticable; here much had to be inserted, and there little; so that complete correspondence
in time could not be maintained. Moreover, it has not been possible to carry out the
mode of clas­si­fi­ca­tion in a the­oret­i­cal­ly-com­plete man­ner, by increasing the number of
columns as the classes of facts multiply in the course of Civilization. To represent truly the
progress of things, each column should divide and sub-divide in successive ages, so as to
indicate the successive dif­fer­entia­tions of the phenomena. But typographical difficulties have
negatived this: a great deal has had to be left in a form which must be accepted simply as the
least unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="fsza">The three Divisions constituting the entire work, comprehend three groups of societies:—(1)
<i>Uncivilized Societies</i>; (2) <i>Civilized Societies—Extinct or Decayed</i>; (3) <i>Civilized Societies—Recent
or Still Flourishing</i>. These divisions have at present reached the following <span class="nowrap">stages:―</span></p>

<p class="fsza"><span class="smcap">D<b>IVISION</b></span> I.—<i>Uncivilized Societies.</i> Commenced in 1867 by
the gentleman I first engaged, Mr. <span class="smcap">D<b>AVID</b></span> <span class="smcap">D<b>UNCAN</b></span>,
M.A. (now Professor of Logic, &amp;c., in the Presidency College, Madras),
and continued by him since he left England, this part of the work is
complete. It contains four parts, including “Types of Lowest Races,”
the “Negrito Races,” the “Malayo-Polynesian Races,” the “African
Races,” the “Asiatic Races,” and the “American Races.”</p>

<p class="fsza"><span class="smcap">D<b>IVISION</b></span> II.—<i>Civilized
 Societies—Extinct or Decayed.</i> On this part of the work Dr. <span class="smcap">R<b>ICHARD</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>CHEPPIG</b></span> has been engaged since January, 1872. The first instalment, including the four
Ancient American Civilizations, was issued in March, 1874. A second instalment, containing
“Hebrews and Phœnicians,” will shortly be issued.</p>

<p class="fsza"><span class="smcap">D<b>IVISION</b></span> III.—<i>Civilized Societies—Recent or Still Flourishing.</i> Of this Division the first
instalment, prepared by Mr. <span class="smcap">J<b>AMES</b></span> <span class="smcap">C<b>OLLIER</b></span>, of St. Andrew’s and Edinburgh Universities, was
issued in August, 1873. This presents the English Civilization. It covers seven consecutive
Tables; and the Extracts occupy seventy pages folio. The next part, presenting in a still
more extensive form the French Civilization, is now in the press.</p>

<p class="fsza">The successive parts belonging to these several Divisions, issued at intervals, are composed
of different numbers of Tables and different numbers of Pages. The Uncivilized Societies
occupy four parts, each containing a dozen or more Tables, with their accompanying Extracts.
Of the Division comprising Extinct Civilized Societies, the first part contains four, and the
second contains two. While of Existing Civilized Societies, the records of which are so much
more extensive, each occupies a single part.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
